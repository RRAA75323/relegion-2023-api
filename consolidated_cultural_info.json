[{"CountryName":"Afghanistan","CulturalInfo":" Housing of AfghanistanAfghanistans climatic and ethnic diversity has contributed to a wide variety of traditional habitations, particularly among the countrys large rural population. Nomadic and transhumant groups have traditionally relied on yurts in the norththese are generally found among the Turkic and Mongol peoplesand tents in the south. The latter are favoured among the Pashtun groups. In the northern and western parts of the country, traditional sedentary settlements often have consisted of fortified villages of stone and mud-brick known as qalahs (fortresses), whereas in the northern and eastern mountain regions wooden, multistoried dwellings were customary among the Nuristani. Until the modern period, urban dwellings were located within modest-sized walled cities, unchanged for centuries in their basic layout. It was only in the 20th century that urban centres began to spill outside the city walls and to take on characteristics associated with Western models, including high-rises, paved roads, and city services. Urban life deteriorated rapidly after the collapse of the communist regime, and a number of cities suffered severe damage to their infrastructures during the 1990s and early 21st century. By that time, few city serviceselectricity, water, sewage disposalremained intact. Regardless, a large number of people fled the countryside, seeking shelter from the civil war. These people remained poorly housed and, lacking a central government, were forced to rely on private means for shelter. Rebuilding the countrys housing stock has been one of the major tasks in national reconstruction.   Education Education is free at all levels, and elementary education is officially compulsory wherever it is provided by the state. Nonetheless, even in the best of years, less than one-fourth of all Afghan children have attended school. Although there are primary schools throughout the country, there are secondary schools in only the provincial and some district centres. Under the Taliban, opportunities for schooling declined, and instruction was devoted mostly to Qurnic studies. Public education for girls virtually disappeared. In the late 1990s less than half of the male population was estimated to be literate, and probably no more than one in seven women. Higher education has been limited to two institutions: Kabul University, founded in 1946 by the incorporation of a number of faculties, the oldest of which is the faculty of medicine, established in 1932, and the University of Nangarhr, established in Jallbd in 1963. The civil war interfered with their operation, especially during the 1990s and again during the U.S. military campaign in 2001.   Cultural life Afghanistan has a rich cultural heritage covering more than 5,000 years and absorbing elements from many cultures, especially those of Iran (Persia) and India. Even elements of Greek culture can be traced to the Hellenistic Age. This blend of cultures flourished at many points in Afghan history, notably under the reign of the Mughal emperors, when Kabul and Hert emerged as important centres of art and learning. Largely because of almost complete isolation from the outside world, however, little in art, literature, or architecture was produced between the 16th and early 20th centuries. Because most Afghans live outside the cities, their mode of living can be described as peasant tribal. Kinship is the basis of social life and determines the patriarchal character of the community. Afghans are also identified by their qawm, a term that can refer to affinity with almost any kind of social group. It essentially divides us from them and helps to distinguish members of one large ethnic or tribal group, or one clan or village, from another. Particular responsibilities and advantages go with membership, and the stability of social and political institutions may vary with their qawm composition. "},{"CountryName":"Albania","CulturalInfo":"Constitutional framework\nThe constitution of the Republic of Albania was promulgated on November 28, 1998. It replaced an interim document from 1991 that had first sanctioned a multiparty political system and officially guaranteed Albanian citizens the freedoms of speech, religion, press, and assembly.\nAlbania is a parliamentary democracy, with 140 deputies elected to four-year terms in the unicameral Parliament. Of those deputies, 100 are elected by direct suffrage, while the remainder are elected by proportional representation. The head of the government, the prime minister, is chosen from the leading party in parliament and selects the Council of Ministers (cabinet). The president, who serves as the head of state, is elected by the Parliament for a five-year term and can serve a limit of two consecutive terms.\nLocal government\nThe country is divided into qark (counties), which are further divided into rrethe (districts). Beneath the districts in the administrative hierarchy are komuna (communes) and bashkia (municipalities). The counties are governed by councils, whose members are either representatives of the municipalities and communes from within the county or are chosen by the council. The cabinet appoints a prefect as its representative for each county. Government at the district and lower levels operates through local councils elected by direct vote for three-year terms.\nJustice and security\nAlbania has a Constitutional Court, a Supreme Court, which is the highest court of appeals, and numerous appeal and district courts. The Constitutional Court justices are appointed by the Parliament to serve one nine-year term. The Supreme Court has 11 members, each of whom is appointed by the president with the consent of the Parliament for a nine-year term. Albania has an army and a navy; Albanians age 19 and older are eligible to serve in the countrys volunteer military forces.\nPolitical process\nSuffrage is universal for citizens age 18 and older. In June 1991 the Albanian Party of Labour, at one time described as the sole leading political force of the state and society, changed its name to the Albanian Socialist Party (ASP). It had ruled Albania since 1944, when it was first known as the Albanian Communist Party. By the mid-1990s the revamped ASP had distanced itself from its past and broadened its appeal among left-leaning voters to emerge as the governing party at the turn of the 21st century.\nThe Democratic Party, a centre-right group that made its debut as the first opposition party in Albania, scored a series of election successes in the early 1990s, but it bore the brunt of the blame for the 1997 economic collapse and fell into opposition. Other political parties of note in the early 21st century were the Social Democratic Party of Albania, the Union for Human Rights Party, and the Albanian Republican Party. There are also several agrarian, ecological, and socialist parties.\nHealth and welfare\nAlbania has a relatively well-developed health care system. The majority of services are provided by the state, though private practice was revived in the early 1990s. At the turn of the 21st century, physicians in Albania had more than twice as many patients as the average European doctor. Nevertheless, there has been a considerable reduction in the incidence of most infectious diseases (including malaria and syphilis, which had been especially widespread), and life expectancy for both men and women in Albania is slightly above the European average, at about 75 and 80 years, respectively. Despite the real improvements in health care, Albania still has a high infant mortality ratelargely a result of poor nutrition and the difficulty of obtaining medical treatment in many rural areas.\nEducation\nThe government has devoted considerable resources to education. Schooling is compulsory between ages 7 and 15. Education at the primary and secondary levels is free, and higher-education fees are based on family income. The University of Tirana (1957) is the countrys major institution of higher education. Tirana also has an agricultural and polytechnic university, along with an impressive network of professional and vocational schools. More than nine-tenths of the population age 15 and older is literate.\nCultural life\nCultural milieu\nCultural development in Albania was handicapped by more than four decades of communist rule. The government imposed strict censorship on the press, publications, and the performing arts. The succeeding governments have made a conscious effort to encourage and preserve the countrys rich folklife. Albania is known for its traditions of hospitality, which are based on the kanun (code), a set of unwritten laws devised in the 15th century by Prince Lek Dukagjin, an Albanian feudal lord. The kanun governs all social relations, including those involving marriage, death, family, and religion. Some Albanians still follow its customary laws, including the right to avenge a killing; gjakmarrje (blood feuds) were known to occur in parts of northern Albania into the 21st century.\nDaily life and social customs\nIn addition to traditional religious holidays, pagan holidays and folklore play a role in Albanian life. Agricultural fairs and religious festivals occur throughout the year and often include competitions that highlight highly skilled sports, which are occasionally contested in the national stadium in Tirana. Dita e Vers (Spring Day) is celebrated in mid-March in Elbasan. Folkloric festivals take place in towns across the country; one of the largest is the National Festival of Folklore held in Gjirokastr, a historic town that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005. Albanias independence is celebrated throughout the country on November 28.\nMuch of Albanias cuisine consists of meat and seafood. Among the most popular dishes are roasts, biftek (beef loin), qebaps (kabobs), and qoft (meatballs). Fergs Tirana, a hot dish of meat, peppers, eggs, and tomatoes, is a specialty of Tirana. In southern Albania, kukurec (sheep intestines broiled on a spit) is a common entree. Carp and the revered but rare koran (trout) are the preferred food fish throughout the country. Oshaf, a pudding made from figs and sheeps milk, is a common dessert. The traditional Albanian drink is raki, a local brandy distilled from grapes that is often imbibed before a meal.\nThe arts\nAlbanias traditional arts are rich and varied. They include fine embroidery and lace making, woodworking, and furniture making. Albanians enjoy music and storytelling, especially savouring the epics recounted by traditional singers. These singers often memorize verses hundreds and even thousands of lines long that celebrate the deeds of ancient heroes. Their tradition, however, seems to be in danger of extinction, for few young Albanians have elected to take up this ancient Balkan art form.\nAlbanian folk music is national in character but has Turkish and Persian influences. Albanian iso-polyphony, derived from Byzantine church music, is a form of group singing that is performed primarily by men. Albanian iso-polyphony was listed by UNESCO in 2005 as an outstanding example of the worlds intangible cultural heritage. Revived in the early 21st century, this folk tradition is still practiced at weddings, festivals, and other social events. Common folk instruments used in Albania include the ifteli (a long-necked two-stringed mandolin) and the grnet (a type of clarinet).\nAlbania boasts a long literary tradition. The countrys best-known contemporary writer is novelist and poet Ismail Kadare, whose work has been translated into some 30 languages. Notable early 20th-century poets include Gjergj Fishta (18711940), Ndre Mjeda (18661937), and Asdren (Alexander Stavre Drenova; 18721947), the last of whom wrote the lyrics for Albanias national anthem.  Fan S. Noli (18821965), an Orthodox bishop who served briefly as prime minister, is remembered for his artful turn-of-the-20th-century translations of some of the worlds classic works of drama and poetry.

A transient, nearly rootless society has emerged, whose cultural continuity has been deeply undermined. Seemingly, only deep religious faith and belief in the nations populist ideology have prevented complete social disintegration. There has been a contradiction, however, between the governments various populist policieswhich have called for the radical modernization of society as well as the cultivation of the countrys Arab Islamic heritageand traditional family structure. Although Algerias cities have become centres for this cultural confrontation, even remote areas of the countryside have seen the state take on roles traditionally filled by the extended family or clan. Algerians have thus been caught between a tradition that no longer commands their total loyalty and a modernism that is attractive yet fails to satisfy their psychological and spiritual needs. Only the more isolated Amazigh groups, such as the Saharan Mzabites and Tuareg, have managed to some degree to escape these conflicting pressures. As is true elsewhere in North Africa, Algeria has experienced a dislocating clash between traditional and mass global culture, with Hollywood films and Western popular music commanding the attention of the young at the expense of indigenous forms of artistic and cultural expression. This clash is the subject of much fiery commentary from conservative Muslim clergymen, whose influence has grown with the rise of Islamic extremism. Extremists have opposed secular values in art and culture and have targeted prominent Algerian authors, playwrights, musicians, and artistsincluding the director of the National Museum, who was assassinated in 1995; novelist Tahar Djaout, who was murdered in 1993; and the well-known Amazigh musician Louns Matoub, who was assassinated in 1998. As a result, much of the countrys cultural elite has left the country to work abroad, mostly in France.   Daily life and social customs Despite efforts to modernize Algerian society, the pull of traditional values remains strong. Whether in the city or countryside, the daily life of the average Algerian is permeated with the atmosphere of Islam, which has become identified with the concept of an autonomous Algerian people and of resistance to what many Algerians perceive as a continued Western imperialism. Practiced largely as a set of social prescriptions and ethical attitudes, Islam in Algeria has more characteristically been identified with supporting traditional values than serving a revolutionary ideology. In particular, the influential Muslim clergy has opposed the emancipation of women. Algerians traditionally consider the familyheaded by the husbandto be the basic unit of society, and women are expected to be obedient and provide support to their husbands. As in most parts of the Arab world, men and women in Algeria generally have constituted two separate societies, each with its own attitudes and values. Daily activities and social interaction normally take place only between members of the same gender. Marriage in this milieu is generally considered a family affair rather than a matter of personal preference, and parents typically arrange marriages for their children, although this custom is declining as Algerian women take on a greater role in political and economic life. Some women continue to wear veils in public because traditionally minded Algerian Muslims consider it improper for a woman to be seen by men to whom she is not related. The practice of veiling has in fact increased since independence, especially in urban areas, where there is a greater chance of contact with nonrelatives. Algerian cuisine, like that of most North African countries, is heavily influenced by Arab, Amazigh, Turkish, and French culinary traditions. Couscous, a semolina-based pasta customarily served with a meat and vegetable stew, is the traditional staple. Although Western-style dishes, such as pizza and other fast foods, are popular and Algeria imports large quantities of foodstuffs, traditional products of Algerian agriculture remain the countrys best-liked. Mutton, lamb, and poultry are still the meat dishes of choice; favourite desserts rely heavily on native-grown figs, dates, and almonds and locally produced honey; and couscous and unleavened breads accompany virtually every meal. Brik (a meat pastry), merguez (beef or lamb sausage), and lamb or chicken stew are among the many local dishes served in homes and restaurants. As is the case in the Middle East, strong, sweet Turkish-style coffee is the beverage of choice at social gatherings, and mint tea is a favourite. Algeria observes several religious and secular holidays, including the important Islamic festivals and commemorations such as Ramadan, the two ds (festivals), Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and mawlid (the Prophets birthday), as well as national holidays such as Independence Day (July 5).   The arts Various types of music are native to Algeria. One of the most popular, originating in the western part of the country, is ra (from Arabic ray, meaning opinion or view), which combines varying instrumentation with simple poetic lyrics. Both men and women are free to express themselves in this style. One especially popular Algerian singer of ra, Khaled, has exported this music to Europe and the United States, but he and other popular musicians such as Cheb Mami have been targets of Islamic extremists. Wahrani (the music of Oran), another style, blends ra with classical Algerian music of the Arab-Andalusian tradition. Algeria has produced many important writers. Some, such as the Nobel Prize winner Albert Camus and his contemporary Jean Snac, were French, although their work was influenced by the many years they spent in Algeria. The writing of Henri Kra reflects the two worlds he inhabited as the son of a French father and an Algerian mother. Abd al-Hamid Benhadugah is the father of modern Arabic literature in Algeria, while Jean Amrouche is considered the foremost poet of the first generation of North African writers who wrote in French; his younger sister Marguerite Taos Amrouche was a noted singer and writer. The work of Mouloud Feraoun reflects Amazigh life. Mohammed Dib, Malek Haddad, Tahar Djaout, Mourad Bourboune, Rachid Boudjedra, and Assia Djebar have all written about contemporary life in Algeria, with Djebar reflecting on this from a womans perspective. Algeria has maintained a lively film industry, although filmmakers frequently have endured bouts with government pressure and, more recently, have been subjected to intimidation by Islamic extremists. The first major postcolonial production was the celebrated film La battaglia di Algeri (1966; The Battle of Algiers). Though written and directed by an Italian, Gillo Pontecorvo, the worka stark factual retelling of urban warfare during the revolutionwas supported by the Algerian government and was cast with numerous nonactors, including many residents of Algiers who participated in the actual events. The following year Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina directed R al-Awras (1966; The Winds of the Aures), the first work by an Algerian to win international acclaim. His Chronique des annees de braise (1975; Chronicle of the Year of Embers), another gritty tale of the revolution, was awarded the Palme dOr at the Cannes film festival nearly a decade later. Several films by the celebrated director Merzak Allouache, including Omar Gatlato (1976) and Bb al-wd al-awmah (1994; Bab El-Oued City), which deal with the complexity of daily life in urban Algeria, have received international recognition. Additionally, director Bourlem Guerdjou examined the difficulties of the Algerian diaspora in France in his award-winning Vivre au paradis (1997; Living in Paradise).  "},{"CountryName":"Angola","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Cultural milieu Precolonial culture in Angola was broadly similar from one end of the country to another, albeit with local variations and some differences stemming from the many, though mostly related, languages spoken in the area. A common traditional culture is still noticeable in Angola. Portuguese contact beginning in the late 15th century produced an overlay of European culture that was accepted to varying degrees in much of the northwestern part of the country. The Portuguese settled at Luanda in 1575 and established the core of colonial Angola in the area approximately 90 miles (150 km) inland from Luanda. By the mid-17th century a mixture of Mbundu and Portuguese culture had emerged in the region, and in 18th-century Luanda, Kimbundu (the language of the Mbundu) predominated as the language of the elite; even Portuguese of considerable stature who resided locally spoke Kimbundu, often in preference to Portuguese. In the 19th century the Luanda elite embraced both Kimbundu and Portuguese culture and language and valued their blended nature, and the eventual cessation of Kimbundu as the language of the elite did not occur until after 1910. In contrast, a class of mixed origin (including government officials, the assimilated African and mulatto population, and, later, the settlers that moved to the country after 1945) that was strongly Portuguese in language and cultural expression developed after 1850 with the Portuguese conquest of the rest of Angola and with the programs of assimilation that were begun in 1910 and intensified after 1926. This predominantly Portuguese culture coexisted with a less-assimilated rural population that harkened back to the mixed culture of earlier times (especially in the Kongo areas) or to the traditional cultures (in those regions brought under Portuguese control after 1850). Protestant missionaries introduced North American and British influences; they were anxious to promote significant cultural changeincluding the introduction of many Western norms under the guise of modernizationas well as religious conversion, although they preferred to teach in indigenous languages. After independence the propaganda of the emerging nationalist movements placed a greater value on the purely African culture, but, because of the colonial policy of assimilation, most educated Angolans were more Portuguese than African in their general cultural orientation. This created considerable cultural conflict and had political implications as well, because those who were assimilated were generally the educational and political leaders. Although rigorous censorship ceased in the 1990s, both the cultural ambiguity of many in the government and the desire to discourage the tribalism that endured initially made Angola, in spite of official positions, less supportive of cultural expressions that were not Portuguese based. However, this began to change in the first decade of the 21st century, as the government appeared to be somewhat more accommodating. Daily life The mixture of Portuguese and African culture has made urban Angola, especially the Luanda region, more like a Latin American than an African country. Its nightclubs, restaurants, and annual Carnival might seem at home in Brazil had not war and security measures made this sort of social life difficult. Nevertheless, the country has much to celebrate in its cuisine, festivals, and artistic traditions. As in much of sub-Saharan Africa, palm oil is an indispensable part of many Angolan dishes, and a number of dishes emphasize the Angolan populations love of seafood. The feast of Nganja, usually celebrated in April, is a harvest festival during which children roast corn. The Futungo market, near Luanda, provides craftsmen with a place to sell their handicrafts. The arts Wood, clay, copper, reeds, ivory, shells, and the human body are the main media for Angolan decorative arts. The wooden sculptures of the Chokwe people, the carved ivories of Cabinda, and the elaborate hairstyles of the Nyaneka and Nkhumbi peoples are especially famous. A number of modern artists and graphic designers work with both African and Western motifs in the general realm of modern African art. Music and dancing play a central role in cultural life, with the drum as the basic instrument; there is also a rich oral literature. Since independence various government research agencies have tried to collect ethnographic material and to do archaeological studies, but their work has been sporadic and limited by the war. Western influences, which tend to predominate in the towns, have increasingly overshadowed traditional culture. During the 19th century, a dynamic group of educated Africans emerged in Angolan towns. These individuals wrote newspaper articles, histories, novels, and poems in Portuguese and also explored Mbundu folklore and ethnography. The right-wing dictatorship in Portugal drove much of this literary activity underground after 1926 but failed to destroy it altogether. Although the leader of the MPLA at independence, Agostinho Neto, was renowned throughout the Portuguese-speaking world for his poetry, his government too curtailed artistic freedom, implementing a rigorous system of censorship. Additional artistic outlets emerged by the mid-1990s with the rise of a national television service and the beginnings of a national film industry. Angola has many traditional instruments, including the ngoma, a bongo drum, and the mpwita, a drum originally found in Kongo. Also noteworthy are the mpungu, a trumpet, and the Luandan hungu, equivalent to the mbulumbumba of southwestern Angola, both types of gourd-resonated musical bow. These stringed instruments traveled with slaves to Brazil, where they developed into the berimbau. Contemporary music in Angola combines the African influences in the music of the Caribbean, the United States, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the Latin influences of Cuba and Brazil. Angolas poverty and civil unrest have provided few opportunities for professional musicians, especially because the Ministry of Culture has exerted much control over commercial music production since independence; despite this, musical expression has flourished in informal sectors. Cultural institutions An ambitious program to expand museums, libraries, and archives, initiated in the postindependence era, has borne little fruit. A National Institute for Cultural Heritage does exist in Luanda, but material from other local museums was either looted or removed to Luanda during the course of the war. The National Historical Archive, also in Luanda, houses material dating to the 17th century. The Kongo Kingdom Museum in Mbanza Congo is home to many cultural artifacts. Many other fine collections built up in colonial times were destroyed, dispersed, or made unavailable to the public. Following the end of the civil war in 2002, the government and private organizations began the process of renovating or rebuilding cultural institutions damaged in the war. Sports and recreation Sports are largely dominated by football (soccer), which is a national passion and is played by people of every social stratum. Some Angolans have become players of distinction, but they tend to compete professionally in Portugal or elsewhere in Europe, where there are more opportunities. In 2006 Angola was one of four sub-Saharan African countries that participated in the World Cup finals. Basketball is growing in popularity in Angola, especially owing to the influence of foreign armed forces fighting on Angolan soil. The sport is played by people of all ages and both sexes, and, because of government support, the mens national team has done well at African championships and participated in the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Media and publishing The press was nationalized in 1976; several newspapers and periodicals are published, mainly in Luanda. The state-run radio station broadcasts in Portuguese, English, French, Spanish, Chokwe, Kikongo, Kimbundu, and Umbundu, as well as a few other African languages. The television station, founded in 1975, is also state-controlled. Although the constitution provides for freedom of the press, it is not always enforced, and some journalists have practiced self-censorship."},{"CountryName":"Argentina","CulturalInfo":" Housing of ArgentinaBuenos AiresColourful buildings on Caminito street in La Boca, a section of Buenos Aires, Argentina.(more)The quality and style of housing in Argentina vary considerably according to location and economic status. Many of the residents of Buenos Aires and other large cities live in high-rise apartments; those in the suburbs reside in ranch-style concrete homes with tile roofs. However, poorer families often inhabit substandard housing in tenements or shantytowns. More than two-fifths of homes in the city of Buenos Aires are rented. Apartments and condominiums account for three-fourths of homes in the capital but only about one-eighth of those in the surrounding suburbs. At least one-fifth of Argentines occupy substandard housing, lacking indoor plumbing (drinking water or toilets) or having either dirt floors or temporary flooring. The government classifies about half of the substandard homes as shacks or shanties. In many, more than three people are crowded into each room.   Education Argentina has one of the more educated populations in Latin America, which is reflected in its large number of schools and a nearly universal literacy rate. Primary education is compulsory and free; secondary and higher education is offered in free public schools and in private schools subsidized by the state. Higher education in Argentina was seriously hampered by the censorship and other strictures of the military government of 197683, but efforts to restore the system began after a civilian government was returned to power. The National University of Crdoba, founded in 1613, is the nations oldest university, and the University of Buenos Aires, founded in 1821, is its largest. Other major national universities are at Mendoza, La Plata, Rosario, and San Miguel de Tucumn. The National Technical University is located at Buenos Aires.   Cultural life Almost all Argentines are descendants of immigrants from Europe, and Argentine culture is a lively blend of European customs and Latin American innovations. Whereas earlier generations of intellectuals, writers, composers, filmmakers, and visual artists looked to European models, the country has developed artistic forms that are uniquely Argentinemost famously the tango, the sexually charged dance of the Buenos Aires dockside district, as well as the dense, metaphysical stories of Jorge Luis Borges, which evoke the back alleys of the capital and the vast Pampas alike. The tensions between those two milieus are important in Argentine thought, for, although most Argentines are urban and look to porteos, or residents of Buenos Aires, as arbiters of taste and trends, the interior has given to all Argentines their symbol of national identity, the gaucho, who occupies a position in South American lore similar to that of the cowboy in the United States. Scorned in his heyday of the 18th and 19th centuries as a drinker and vagabond, this mestizo ranch hand rode the open rangeland of the huge estancias in pursuit of wild horses and criollo cattle. Eventually Argentines came to see him as a character whose solitary life taught him self-reliance, courage, indifference to hardship, and love of the landtraits that represented the ideal of their national character as set out in the national epic poem El gaucho Martin Fierro (1872) by Jos Hernndez, in Ricardo Giraldess fictional classic Don Segunda Sombra (1926), and in works by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Benito Lynch.  Daily life and social customs Buenos AireschimichurriOverhead view of sliced beef steak dressed with chimichurri sauce.(more)Daily life in Argentinas cities is much as it is in those of southern Europe: businesses and shops open early, close for a long break at midday, and stay open into the evening; social life takes place both in the streets and in lively bars and nightclubs; and meals are an opportunity for convivial exchanges. New and Old World cultures meet in the Argentine diet, where breakfast is generally a serving of three sweet rolls (medialunas) and coffee in the French fashion, and supper is taken, in the Spanish tradition, after 9:00 pm, often featuring Italian dishes. The New World asserts itself in the Argentine passion for beef cooked on the grill (parrilla), which is overwhelmingly preferred to other meats and fish. Argentina consumes more beef per capita than any other nation except Uruguay, twice the amount per capita as the United States. Buenos Aires is renowned for its steakhouses (asados criollos, but nearly every culinary tradition is represented in one or more of the citys restaurants. Chimichurri, a sauce of Argentine origin that typically includes parsley, oregano, garlic, and red wine vinegar, has long since been internationalized, with a taste that reflects the manifold flavours brought by immigrants from different European countries. Mat, the native tealike beverage brewed from yerba mat leaves, is popular in the countryside and is drunk from a gourd through a strainer; it is either sipped individually or shared in an important social ritual. Argentina is one of the largest wine producers in the world, and its varietal red wines are highly prized by connoisseurs, though most production goes toward supplying high domestic consumption. Salta, ArgentinaThe Salta Cabildo is a historic colonial building in Salta, Argentina.(more)Most Argentines observe the Roman Catholic calendar of holidays, including Christmas and Easter. San Martin Day (August 17), Venticinco de Mayo (May 25, the anniversary of the revolution of 1810), and Nueve de Julio (July 9, Independence Day) are among the principal national holidays. Regional festivals include the Fiesta del Milagros (Miracle Festival) in Salta, commemorating the salvation of the city from an earthquake in September 1692, the celebration on July 6 of the founding of Crdoba, and the wine festival in Mendoza in March.  "},{"CountryName":"Armenia","CulturalInfo":" Government and society  Constitutional framework In 1995 Armenia adopted a new constitution, replacing the Soviet-era constitution that had been in force from 1978. The 1995 document establishes legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government and provides for a strong executive. A number of basic rights and freedoms of citizens are enumerated. The constitution has since been amended twice through referendum: once in 2005 and once in 2015. Armenia is a unitary multiparty republic. Legislative authority is vested in a 105-member National Assembly. Members are elected to five-year terms. The legislature has the authority to approve the budget, ratify treaties, and declare war. The head of state is the president, elected by the National Assembly and limited to one seven-year term. The presidents role is largely ceremonial and primarily consists of executing decisions of the National Assembly or the cabinet pertaining to government positions, foreign relations, or the armed forces. The prime minister is the head of government and commander in chief of the armed forces and is elected by a parliamentary majority and subsequently appointed by the president. Upon resignation of the prime minister, the National Assembly must elect a new prime minister within two votes in two weeks. If a new prime minister is not elected within two votes in two weeks, the National Assembly is dissolved and early elections are triggered. The judiciary consists of trial courts, appellate courts, a Court of Cassation (the highest appellate court), and a nine-member Constitutional Court, which determines the constitutionality of legislation and executive decrees. The members of these courts are appointed variously: most judicial appointments are elected or recommended by the National Assembly, while others are appointed by the president at the recommendation of a judicial council.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tBritannica Quiz\t\tWhich Country Is Larger?

During the Soviet period political life was directed by the Communist Party of Armenia, which was controlled by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Armenian National Movement, a moderate nationalist party, governed Armenia from independence until 1998. Major parties in the 21st century have included the conservative Republican Party of Armenia, which dominated the government from 1999 through 2018, and the centre-right Prosperous Armenia Party, founded by businessman Garik Tsarukyan. In 2018 a series of popular protests led by Nikol Pashinyan upended Republican dominance in favour of his populist Civil Contract party. Armenia was a founding member of the Commonwealth of Independent States. In 1992 Armenia joined the United Nations.   Security The Armenian military, formed partly out of forces that had belonged to the Soviet Union, includes an army and an air force. Military service is compulsory, though draft evasion is common. Armenia supplies weapons, matriel, and troops to the Karabakh Self-Defense Army in Nagorno-Karabakh. The Ministry of Internal Affairs controls the regular Armenian police force. Organized crime increased sharply during the 1990s.   Education Countrywide eight-year schooling has become the standard. There are trade schools, secondary specialized educational establishments, and institutes and colleges. Establishments of higher learning include Yerevan State University; polytechnical, medical, agricultural, pedagogical, and theatrical institutes; and a conservatory.   Health and welfare Medical treatment in hospitals and clinics is free of charge for all citizens, being supported, like education, by taxation. The government provides modest benefits to the elderly, the unemployed, and parents of young children.   Cultural life Armenian written literature began in the 5th century ad, and monasteries became the principal centres of intellectual life. The earliest works were historical, such as Moses of Khorens History of Armenia. The masterpiece of classical Armenian is Eznik Koghbatsis Eghts aghandots (Refutation of the Sects). The first great Armenian poet (10th century) was St. Gregory Narekatzi, renowned for his mystical poems and hymns. During the 16th to 18th century, popular bards, or troubadours, called ashugh, arose; outstanding among them were Nahapet Kuchak and, especially, Aruthin Sayadian, called Sayat-Nova (d. 1795), whose love songs are still popular. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Hakob Paronian and Ervand Otian were notable satirical novelists, and Grigor Zohrab wrote realist short stories. Paronian was also a comic playwright, whose plays still entertain Armenian audiences. The most celebrated novelist was Hakob Meliq-Hakobian, called Raffi, and perhaps the best dramatist of recent times was Gabriel Sundukian (d. 1912). The country boasts a State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet, several drama theatres, theatres for children, orchestras, a national dance company, and the Yerevan film studios, which produce feature, documentary, and science films. The traditional folk arts, especially singing, dancing, and artistic crafts, are popular. The 20th-century Armenian composer Aram Khachaturian achieved worldwide renown. The public libraries include the A.F. Myasnikyan State Public Library and the Matenadaran archives in Yerevan, which contain 10,000 Armenian manuscripts, the largest collection in the world. There are also a number of museums, including the State Historical Museum of Armenia. Armenian science, like its culture, has its roots in antiquity, but research institutions are a 20th-century development. The Armenian Academy of Sciences is composed of a number of institutes engaged in research problems in natural and social sciences. The radio broadcasting system has been operating since 1926, and the Yerevan television centre since 1956. Broadcasts and telecasts are conducted in Armenian, Russian, Azerbaijani, and Kurdish. Many newspapers and periodicals are published in Armenia, most of them in the Armenian language. Aleksey Aleksandrovich Mints G. Melvyn Howe "},{"CountryName":"Australia","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life Australias isolation as an island continent has done much to shapeand inhibitits culture. The Aboriginal peoples developed their accommodation with the environment over a period of at least 40,000 years, during which time they had little contact with the outside world. When Britain settled New South Wales as a penal colony in 1788, it did so partly because of the continents remoteness. Australias convict heritage ensured that European perceptions of the environment were often influenced by the sense of exile and alienation. Yet, the distance from Britainand the isolation it imposedstrengthened rather than weakened ties with it. The ambivalence of the continuing colonial relationship, which only began to be dismantled in the second half of the 20th century, has been a central cultural preoccupation in Australia. Until World War II, Australian culture was almost exclusively Anglo-Celtic. The Aboriginal population was small and persecuted, and the Commonwealth governments exclusivist White Australia policy helped to maintain the continents striking cultural homogeneity. However, in the second half of the 20th century, immigration rules were relaxed, and large influxes of both immigrants and refugees from eastern Asia, the Middle East, and various continental European countries made their way to Australia, each leaving an indelible imprint on the continents culture. Likewise, a revival of Aboriginal identity and positive measures from the government to redress past wrongs, along with a dramatic increase in the Aboriginal population, unleashed a renaissance in the Aboriginal arts.  Daily life and social customs Australians are proud of their heritage and progressproud of the fact that a nation of convicts and working-class folks could build a modern egalitarian society in a rough and inhospitable land. They typically disdain the pompous and ostentatious, and they are often characterized as informal and laid back, an impression fostered by the typical and now internationally recognized greeting among mates and sheilas: Gday (Good day). Their tastes in popular fashions and entertainment differ little from those in Europe and North America, and their humour is often characterized as sarcastic, ironic, and self-deprecating. Drinking and gambling have long been important aspects of Australian popular culture, despite persistent government attempts to regulate and limit them. Beer has traditionally been the drink of choice, but the explosion of Australian wine production has somewhat altered patterns. Since World War II, laws generally have been liberalized in favour of more civilized drinking and greater access to gambling, often through government-owned agencies. However, whereas an older generation turned to the pub for socializing, many of the young are likely to seek out the disco or trendy bar or restaurant. Australian bush foodTraditional foods from Australias Outback, called bush food.(more)Australian cuisine is a product of international trends and the contributions of its Aboriginal and immigrant communities. Nevertheless, it has been heavily influenced by the countrys Anglo-Celtic heritage, with the traditional British supper still common. Barbecues (the barbie) are a quintessential Australian pastime, and meat is ubiquitous. Traditional Aboriginal Outback cuisine consists of such unique foods as kangaroo, wombat, turtle, eel, emu, snake, and witchetty grubs (larvae of the ghost moth). Vegemite, a salty, dark-brown yeast extract, has long been a staple of the Australian diet. VegemiteVegemite being spread on a slice of toast.(more)Prior to the 1950s, very few European delicacies had been introduced to Australia, and it was difficult to obtain products such as olive oil and pasta. However, today, Italian food is a significant part of the national culinary culture, and pizza and pasta are among the most popular dishes in Australia. Immigrant traditions and customs also have had a major influence on Australian society and culture. In addition to cuisine, Chinese contributions include medicine and therapy (e.g., acupuncture and Shiatsu massage). The calendar is well endowed with public holidays, making the long weekend an institution. ANZAC Day (April 25), marking the Australian and New Zealand landing at Gallipoli in 1915, is observed throughout Australia. Australia Day (January 26) celebrates the 1788 arrival of the British First Fleet at Sydney Cove and the proclaiming of Australia as a British possession. The British monarchs birthday is also celebrated in June (October in Western Australia). In addition, the states have several regional holidays. Australia hosts many festivals, which often attract a wide international audience. Particularly noteworthy arts events are the Sydney Festival (January), which features concerts and theatre and is accompanied by fireworks displays; the biennial Adelaide Festival of Arts (March); and the Melbourne Festival (October). Aboriginal arts festivals include the Barunga and Cultural Sports Festival (June) and Stompin Ground (October), held in Broome. Sydneys vibrant Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, held annually in February, attracts hundreds of thousands of revelers from around the world and is considered the worlds largest celebration of its kind. Chinese cultural celebrations include Chinese New Year, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Lantern Festival.   The arts  Literature The original inhabitants of Australia used the oral tradition, including song and dance with gestural storytelling, to entertain, instruct, guide, and reveal spiritual truths, as well as physical geography and the location of life-sustaining resources. (See Australian literature.) This tradition, disrupted and more or less destroyed by the arrival of the British, was replaced by a literature that imitated European models. In the mid-19th century, the Australian landscape, flora, and fauna became the setting for many novels, and, soon after, the colonial experience became a popular subject. Although the bush, or Outback, loomed large in the national consciousness, Australia has been a characteristically urban society, even from its days as a penal colony. Writers as diverse as Robin Boyd, Donald Horne, and Hugh Stretton, as well as the satirist Barry Humphries (Dame Edna Everage), drew attention to the significance of the suburban ethos in Australian culture. Patrick White, Australias greatest novelist and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1973, explored the negative potentialities of a country in the process of defining itself. Contemporary Australian writers such as Thomas Keneally, Thea Astley, David Malouf, Peter Carey, Hal Porter, Janette Turner Hospital, Elizabeth Jolley, and Tim Winton continue to draw an international following.   Performing arts  Dance Perhaps best-known among Australias dance troupes is the world-renowned national company, the Australian Ballet (founded 1962). Like the state-sponsored Queensland Ballet (1960) and West Australian Ballet (1953), it presents both classical and contemporary programs, though unlike them it tours internationally as well as regionally. Also noteworthy are Australian Dance Theatre (1965; contemporary dance), Dance North (1970), One Extra Dance Company (1976), Sydney Dance Company (1979), TasDance (1981), Legs on the Wall (1984), and Buzz Dance Theatre (1985). Bangarra Dance Theatre (1989), which blends the ancient traditions and spirit of the first Australians with the contemporary concerns of indigenous peoples, reached a large international audience when it performed in the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympic Games.   Music Like the other arts in Australia, music there has two distinct traditions: those of the European colonists and those of the indigenous peoples, whose singing and ritual playing of the didjeridu (a drone instrument) reenact the ancient traditions related to a mythological time called the Dreaming, the Aboriginal conception of creation. Contemporary Aboriginal bands (such as Warumpi Band and Yothu Yindi in the early 21st century) incorporate elements of ancestral rituals. The European-based musical tradition also maintains its vitality in the contemporary scene. Australian opera fans can point to talent ranging from the popular coloratura soprano Dame Nellie Melba to the Australian filmmaker Baz Luhrmanns 21st-century production of Giacomo Puccinis La Bohme. Traditional symphony orchestras abound, the Bee GeesThe Bee Gees, 1996.(more)Australian musicians also have made important contributions to the development of rock music, which has been central to Australian popular culture since the late 1950s, when Americans Bill Haley and His Comets first brought rock and roll to Australia. In 1958 Johnny OKeefe became the first Australian rock and roll singer to reach the national charts, with his hit Wild One. The first Australian rockers to have an impact outside the country were the Easybeats, who formed at an immigrant hostel near Sydney and scored an international hit with Friday on My Mind in 1966. Although the Easybeats would struggle to repeat that success, two of the bands members, George Young and Harry Vanda, would go on to be a prolific songwriting and producing team. Moreover, two of Youngs brothers would later be key contributors to one of Australias biggest musical exports, superstar heavy metal band AC/DC. Another set of Australian siblings, the Bee Gees (short for Brothers Gibb), found similar international success in the pop and disco realm. AC/DCAC/DC, 2009.(more)AC/DC had emerged from Australias vibrant pub rock scene. Live-music venues thrived throughout the country and produced a number of bands that enjoyed limited foreign success but had huge followings in Australia and other bands that were popular beyond the countrys borders. Among the most notable were Daddy Cool (Eagle Rock, 1971), the Masters Apprentices, hard-rocking Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, soft rockers Air Supply and the Little River Band, blues-based Chain, glam rockers Skyhooks, and Cold Chisel, which was fronted by raspy-voiced everyman Jimmy Barnes and whose 1973 anthem Khe Sanh evocatively conveys the experience of Australian veterans of the Vietnam War. Female vocalists Helen Reddy, Olivia Newton-John, and, later, Kylie Minogue found success by taking their talents abroad. Central to Australian rock and pop music in the 1970s and beyond was the television music program Countdown, hosted by Ian (Molly) Meldrum. By the 1980s a bounty of Australian pop, rock, and alternative rock performers were enjoying worldwide success, including Men at Work (Down Under, 1981), Midnight Oil, Crowded House, Hunters and Collectors, the Divinyls, and INXS. Several punk-influenced alternative performersnotably Nick Cave, the Go-Betweens, the Saints, and the Triffidssought fame in exile, relocating to England, as the Easybeats and the folk-rock group the Seekers (Georgy Girl, 1966) had done in the 1960s. The latter-day expatriates found limited commercial success, though they were critics darlings and gained cult followings. Throughout the 1990s and on into the 21st century, the list of Australian rock and pop performers who made a significant impact on international audiences grew to include Hoodoo Gurus, Silverchair, Jet, the Sleepy Jackson, Powderfinger, Savage Garden, Wolfmother, the Living End, and Courtney Barnett.   Theatre For indigenous Australians, the corroboree comes closest to a modern concept of theatre, but this participatory public performance of songs and dances represents much more than entertainment; it is a celebration of Aboriginal mythology and spirituality. Groups such as Bangarra Dance Theatre bring a modern sensibility to bear on the storytelling and ritual essential to Aboriginal culture. European-based contemporary Australian theatre is characterized by its emphasis on smaller, regional theatre groups. Australias larger cities offer fringe theatre as well as mainstream and alternative performances. Most of these troupes are committed to presenting the work of Australian playwrights, including Alexander Buzo, Jack Davis, Tim Robertson, and David Williamson.   "},{"CountryName":"Austria","CulturalInfo":"Education of AustriaThe federal government oversees education in Austria. A major reform of the school administrative structure, providing for a unitary school system with access to higher education and experimentation with various types of schools, was initiated in 1970 and led to an educational revolution with free access to many avenues of basic, advanced, and vocational instruction for everyone. School attendance is obligatory between ages 6 and 15. Intermediate schools include those preparing students for university and other higher studies, for teachers and commercial colleges, and for other specialized institutions. The academic Gymnasium is the secondary school leading to the university. Austria has a number of universities and fine arts colleges. The University of Vienna was founded in 1365. The University of Graz was founded in 1585, and the universities of Innsbruck and Salzburg were founded during the 17th century. Separate technical universities are located at Vienna and Graz. Reforms were initiated in 1975 to expand and democratize university programs and governing procedures. A wide program of adult education is available throughout the country.Cultural life Cultural milieu Kunsthistorisches MuseumKunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Austria.(more)Austria has been a leader and guardian of some of the most sublime achievements in music, theatre, literature, architecture, medicine, and science. Austrian culture is a part of the mainstream of Germanic culture that is shared with Germany and Switzerland. But what has shaped it and dominated it, what has made it essentially Austrian, are the Habsburg empire and the Christian church. The emperor Maximilian I (reigned 14931519) was a poet and a patron of the theatre, and the era that began in the reign of Maria Theresa (174080) and ended in that of Francis Joseph (18481916) was an age of spectacular flourishing in the arts and sciences. During this time an aggregation of genius and talent in often interlocking circles was gathered in Vienna. Moreover, the Habsburg dynastys tradition of patronage of the arts has carried over to the modern republic of today. The church was a powerful influence on Austrian architecture, drama, and music. The great Romanesque monasteries, the Gothic St. Stephens Cathedral in Vienna, and the splendours of the quintessentially Austrian Baroqueexemplified by the works of Austrian architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and the Bohemian architects Christoph Dientzenhofer and Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhoferand Rococo obviously derive from the church. The Austrian theatre has its origins in late medieval religious drama, and the affinities of the church with Austrian music continue down to modern times. Despite the fact that Austrian high culture never has been contained by the borders of the country but rather is considered part of the greater cultural realm of the German-speaking world, many Austrians long imagined their country as blissfully isolated and neutralan island of the blessed. In fact, for many years after World War II, Austria promoted the idea of having been the first victim of Nazi Germany and, some would say, deliberately avoided confronting the guilt surrounding its participation in the Anschluss (Union) with Germany. But by the end of the 20th century, the forces of globalization and international competition, spurred by the opening of the Iron Curtain in 1989 and Austrias admittance to the EU in 1995, had brought Austrias imagined perfection into question. The increased immigration of foreigners into the country has caused particular concern among many Austrians, who fear that their carefully tailored social welfare system may be overburdened and their own Austrian identity threatened. Such sentiment has appeared particularly strong in Vienna, where large numbers of immigrants reside. Daily life and social customs Most ordinary Austrians may be aware of Austrias historical contributions to high culture, but in general only members of the educated middle class and the elite circles of society participate in glamorous cultural events like the Salzburg Festival of theatre and music. Ordinary Austrians, particularly those who live in small towns and in the rural valleys of the countryside, pursue a more commonbut in no way less typically Austriancultural life, with its roots in regional traditions, age-old rituals and customs, and a friendly communal spirit. Membership in local organizations called Vereine plays a great role in this culture. Informal gatherings are commonplace as well, and going out to meet friends in restaurants or cafs is an integral part of everyday life. A surprisingly large number of Austrians play instruments in bands, sing in choirs, or make music in smaller groups at home or with neighbours. Many wear traditional costumes (Trachten), such as full-skirted dirndls or loden coats, every day, and many more wear them on weekends and on festive or special occasions, including weddings and funerals. Although popular music, motion pictures, television, and other elements of popular culture are enjoyed throughout the country, these aspects of traditional Austrian culture remain important, even to the young. Most Austrians celebrate the major Christian holidays, though many revered Austrian traditions surrounding these holidays are said to have their roots in pre-Christian times. Glcklerlauf, a festival that takes place the evening before Epiphany (January 6), is celebrated especially in the mountainous regions of Obersterreich, Steiermark, and Tirol and features activities meant to drive away the evil spirits of winter. During the festival, young men and boys wear loudly clanging bells and carry handmade masksoften extremely large, lighted from within, and decorated with Christian and secular designson their heads and shoulders. "},{"CountryName":"Azerbaijan","CulturalInfo":" Administration and social conditions  Government Azerbaijans 1978 Soviet-era constitution was subsequently revised or superseded by the 1991 Act of Independence and by presidential and parliamentary decree. In 1995 a new constitution was overwhelmingly approved by referendum. The constitution provides for a unicameral legislature, whose members are directly elected to five-year terms. The head of state is the president, who is also elected by direct universal suffrage to a term of seven years. A constitutional amendment that was passed in 2009 removed the presidencys two-term limit. Political parties include the New Azerbaijan Party (founded by former president Heydar Aliyev), the pro-Turkish, nationalist Azerbaijan Popular Front, the New Equality Party (Musavat), the Azerbaijan Social Democratic Party, the Azerbaijan National Independence Party, and the Azerbaijan United Communist Party, which was founded after its predecessor was banned in 1991. In 1992 Azerbaijan joined the United Nations, and in 1993 it formally became a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).   Armed forces and security Azerbaijan formed a national military in 1991, including an army (consisting partly of personnel and matriel from the Soviet 4th Army), navy, and air force. Russian forces completed their withdrawal from Azerbaijan in 1993. Military service is voluntary; individuals are eligible to serve in the armed forces at 18 years of age, and service obligations last for 18 months (12 months for university graduates). The conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh dominated Azerbaijani military planning during the 1990s. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is responsible for internal security and general police work, was reorganized in 1993. Crime rates in Azerbaijan rose during the 1990s, exacerbated by the social dislocation that accompanied the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.   Education Education in Azerbaijan is compulsory between ages 6 and 17. Primary education begins at age 6; secondary education, which begins at age 10, consists of two cycles of five and two years, respectively. Azerbaijani is the primary language of instruction, although in higher education, some technical fields continue to favour Russian. In the Soviet period illiteracy was virtually eradicated, and a network of institutes of higher education, research centres, and similar bodies was established. A number of universities and institutes of learning are located in Baku. Among these are the Azerbaijan State Economic University (founded in 1929), which includes faculties of commerce, finance, and management; the Azerbaijan State University of Languages (founded 1937; current name and status, 2000), which includes faculties of Russian, English, and French; the Azerbaijan State University of Culture and Fine Arts (founded 1945); the Azerbaijan Medical University (founded 1930), which includes faculties of dentistry, pediatrics, general medicine, and pharmacy; and the Azerbaijan Technical University (founded 1950), which offers study in areas that include machine sciences, metallurgy, radio engineering and communications, and transportation. The Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences (founded 1945), also located in Baku, coordinates the activities of research centres, including institutes of cybernetics, physics, theoretical problems of chemical technology, petrochemical processes, and genetics.   Health and welfare Azerbaijan has a well-established health service with some specialized clinics and medical research institutes. Medical services, provided free to patients, are supported by general taxation on individual workers and by taxes on income of factories and other firms.   Cultural life In the course of its long history, Azerbaijan has given the world a number of outstanding thinkers, poets, and scientists. Among the medieval scientists and philosophers, Abul Hasan Bakhmanyar (11th century), the author of numerous works on mathematics and philosophy, and Abul Hasan Shirvani (11th12th centuries), the author of Astronomy, may be noted. The poet and philosopher Nzm, called Ganjav after his place of birth, Ganja, was the author of Khamseh (The Quintuplet), composed of five romantic poems, including The Treasure of Mysteries, Khosrow and Shrn, and Leyli and Mejnn. The people of Azerbaijan have retained their ancient musical tradition. For example, the art of ashugs, who improvise songs to their own accompaniment on a stringed instrument called a kobuz, remains extremely popular. Mugams, vocal and instrumental compositions, are also widely known, the town of Shusha being particularly renowned for this art. Azerbaijans cultural institutions, including museums, theatres, and public libraries, are located in Baku. Many of them were established after World War II. The city has museums devoted to the art, history, and literature of Azerbaijan. In Nagorno-Karabakh there is a museum with material on the history and archaeology of the Armenian people of the region. The opera and ballet are widely attended. Some of Azerbaijans composers, notably Uzeir Hajjibekov (the operas Ker-Ogly and Leyli and Mejnn and the operetta Arshin Mal Alan) and Kara Karayev (the ballets Seven Beauties and The Path of Thunder), have international reputations. The latters symphonic music is also well known abroad. Throughout the Soviet period Azerbaijani literature was controlled by a system that saw mortal danger in even a modicum of creative freedom. Azerbaijani writers and other intellectuals were closely supervised and subjected to varying degrees of persecution. Azerbaijan has no private publishing; several government firms publish scientific books and magazines as well as books and magazines about art and literature in Azerbaijani, Russian, and other languages. In 1992 the Azerbaijani government switched from the Cyrillic to the Roman alphabet. The magazines Literaturny Azerbaydzhan (in Russian), Azerbaijan Gadn (Azerbaijan Woman, in Azerbaijani), and Azerbaydzhanskoye neftyanoye khozyaystvo (Azerbaijan Petroleum Economy, in Russian) have the highest circulation. Baku has several radio stations, a television studio, and a film studio. Evgeny Dmitrievich Silaev Edward Allworth G. Melvyn Howe  History In ancient and early medieval times, eastern Transcaucasia was populated by Iranian speakers, nomadic Turkic tribes, Kurds, and the Caucasian Albanians, who converted to Christianity in the 4th century and came under the cultural influence of the Armenians. After Arab incursions in the 7th century, Islamic polities were established under local rulers called shhanshhs. The Seljuq invasions in the 11th century changed the composition of the local population and resulted in the linguistic dominance of Oghuz Turkic languages. But, unlike the Ottoman Turks who came to dominate Anatolia, the Caucasian Muslims of Azerbaijan in the early 16th century became Shii, rather than Sunni, Muslims, and they continued to develop under Persian social and cultural influence. Persian-ruled khanates in Shirvan (amax), Baku, Ganja (Gnc), Karabakh, and Yerevan dominated this frontier of afavid Iran. "},{"CountryName":"Bahrain","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Bahrains island location has made it unique among Persian Gulf states. With greater access to ocean travel and broader exposure to outside influences, Bahrain traditionally has been home to a more ethnically and religiously diverse and cosmopolitan population than have other, more insular gulf states. This openness is reflected in Bahrains social customs, whichalthough still conservativeare much more moderate and relaxed than those of its neighbours, particularly conservative Saudi Arabia. Thus, although Bahrain is still at heart an Arab-Islamic country, it has been more accepting of modernization and Westernization than many of its neighbours. Daily life and social customs The official holidays in Bahrain are generally the same as those observed in most Muslim countries. These include the two festivals, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, the Prophet Muhammads birthday, and, more recently, the celebration of shr among the countrys Shiis. Western-style clothing is common in Bahrain, though some men still wear the traditional thawb (full-length tunic) and the kaffiyeh (white head cloth), bound in place by a black, camel-hair cord known as an iqlthe latter often more ornate, particularly among the political elite. The dress rules for women are relaxed compared to the more conservative, regional standards, although women in rural areas, and those in conservative communities in cities, still wear the veil (ijab) and a traditional long cloak known as an abyah. Coffee is an important part of social life. Coffee shops are popular meeting places, and coffee is offered as a sign of hospitality. It is often flavoured with cardamom and saffron. Bahraini cuisine typically features fish, shrimp, meat, rice, and dates. Machbous is a popular traditional dish of fish or meat served with rice. Other typical food includes muammar, sweet brown rice with sugar or dates, and shwarmah, spit-roasted lamb, beef, or chicken. The arts Bahrain: dhow constructionA dhow under construction in a boatyard on the coast of Bahrain.(more)Traditional handicraft industries receive state and popular support, and most villages practice specialized traditions; l, for example, is well known for its ceramics, while artists in Karbbd weave baskets from date-palm leaves. Throughout the country artisans engage in gold working, tinsmithing, and textile making and sell their wares at small shops or the Souk al-Araba (Wednesday Market) in Manama. Shipyards at Manama and Al-Muarraq are sites of dhow building, a highly respected art form. The museum in Manama contains local artifacts dating from antiquity, such as ivory figurines, pottery, copper articles, and gold rings, many of which reflect various cultural influences from outside Bahrain. There is also a small but flourishing avant-garde art community. Music is an important part of Bahraini life. There is a rich folk music culture, and fidjeri, songs once sung by pearl divers, are still heard. Since 1991 the country has held an annual music festival. Although the country does not have a film industry, moviegoing is a popular activity, and some of Bahrains cinema theatres screen English-language films. In the early 21st century the government undertook a program to encourage the development of theatre. Cultural institutions Bahrain has several museums, including the Bahrain National Museum and Beit al-Qurn, which houses a large collection of Qurns, some dating to the 7th century. There are also museums devoted to the history of petroleum production and to pearl diving as well as several art galleries. The Bahraini Ministry of Education maintains a network of public libraries, the oldest of which, in Manama, opened in 1946. The emirate also maintains one of the principal wildlife conservation areas in the Persian Gulf region, Al-Areen Park, which harbours such indigenous mammals as the oryx and gazelle and is visited by many waterfowl species. Sports and recreation Football (soccer) is the most popular modern sport, while horse racing remains a national pastime. More than 20 types of Arabian horses are bred on the islands, and races are held weekly on Bahrain islands large racecourse, which seats some 10,000 spectators. Traditional sports such as falconry and gazelle and hare hunting are still practiced by wealthier Bahrainis, and camel racing is a popular public entertainment. The country first competed in the Summer Olympic Games in 1984; it has not participated in the Winter Games. Media and publishing Several weekly and daily papers are published in Arabic, and a small number appear in English. Most of the press is privately owned and is not subject to censorship as long as it refrains from criticizing the ruling family. The state television and radio stations broadcast most programs in Arabic, although there are channels in English.History This discussion focuses on Bahrain since the 19th century. For a treatment of earlier periods and of the country in its regional context, see Arabia, history of. Bahrain has been inhabited since prehistoric times, and several thousand burial mounds in the northern part of the main island probably date from the Sumerian period of the 3rd millennium bce. It was the seat of ancient Dilmun (Telmun), a prosperous trading centre linking Sumer with the Indus valley about 2000 bce. The archipelago was mentioned by Persian, Greek, and Roman geographers and historians. It has been Arab and Muslim since the Muslim conquest of the 7th century ce, though it was ruled by the Portuguese from 1521 to 1602 and by the Persians from 1602 to 1783. Since 1783 it has been ruled by sheikhs of the Khalfah family (l Khalfah), which originated in the Al-as province of Arabia. The British protectorate Several times during the 19th century, the British intervened to suppress war and piracy and to prevent the establishment of Egyptian, Persian, German, or Russian spheres of influence. The first Bahraini-British treaty was signed in 1820, although the countrys British-protected status dates from 1861, with the completion of a treaty by which the sheikh agreed to refrain from the prosecution of war, piracy, or slavery. Thus, Britain assumed responsibility for the defense of Bahrain and for the conduct of its relations with other major powers. In 1947 this protection briefly became the responsibility of the government of British India, which had both commercial and strategic interests in the Persian Gulf, but it reverted to Britain following Indias independence. Until 1970 the government of Iran periodically advanced claims to sovereignty over Bahrain, but these were repudiated. Britains decision to withdraw all of its forces from the gulf in 1968 led Sheikh Isa ibn Salman Al Khalifah to proclaim Bahrains independence in August 1971. A treaty of friendship was signed with the United Kingdom, terminating Bahrains status as a British protectorate, and Sheikh Isa was designated the emir. Bahrain then became a member of the United Nations and the Arab League. "},{"CountryName":"Bangladesh","CulturalInfo":" Education of BangladeshThe foundation of the educational system in Bangladesh was laid down during the period of British rule. The system has three levelsprimary, secondary, and higher education. Primary and secondary education are both compulsory, though universal participation has remained more an ideal than a fact. Primary education consists of eight years, while secondary education lasts four years. Secondary education is divided into a lower level and a higher level, and public examinations are held at the conclusion of each level of schooling. Schools in cities and towns are generally better-staffed and better-financed than those in rural areas. There are hundreds of colleges, most of them affiliated with one of the larger universities, such as the University of Dhaka (1921), the University of Rajshahi (1953), or the University of Chittagong (1966). Other prominent institutions include Jahangirnagar University (1970) on the outskirts of the capital, the Bangladesh Agricultural University (1961) at Mymensingh, the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (1962) at Dhaka, and the Islamic University (1980) at Kushtia. Medical education is provided by several medical colleges and an institute of postgraduate medicine at Dhaka. Each college or institute has a full-fledged hospital attached to it. For vocational training Bangladesh relies on several engineering colleges and a network of polytechnic and law colleges. In addition, an array of specialized colleges are dedicated to training students in areas such as the arts, home economics, social welfare and research, and various aspects of agriculture. Literacy improved significantly in the 21st century: less than half of the population could read and write at the beginning of the century, but by the late 2010s more than two-thirds were literate.   Cultural life The Bengali language, Islamic religion, and rural character of Bangladesh all serve to unify the countrys culture to a considerable degree. Although some regional variation occurs across the Bengali community, cultural differences between ethnic, religious, and social minorities and between rural and urban populations are much more salient.  Daily life and social customs The typical household in Bangladesh, particularly in the villages, includes several generations of extended family. Most marriages are arranged by parents or other relatives, but increasing numbers of educated men and women choose their own partners. Custom and religion among Muslims require that a dowry be offered by the husband to the wife, but it is usually claimed only in the event of separation or at the husbands death. Divorce is permissible among Muslims, and Muslim law (Sharah) permits limited polygyny, although it is not widespread. Hindus may obtain a separation by application to a court of law. The main festivals in Bangladesh are religious. The two most important are Eid al-Fitr, which comes at the end of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, and Eid al-Adha, the festival of sacrifice, which falls on the 10th day of the last month of the Islamic calendar. On both occasions families and friends exchange visits. While rice, pulses, and fish continue to constitute the staple diet of Bangladeshis, shortages of rice since World War II have forced the acceptance of wheat and wheat products as alternatives. Meat, including goat and beef, also is eaten, especially in the towns. At weddings and other festive occasions, seasoned rice (pilau) accompanies highly spiced meat dishes and curries. Bangladesh is noted for a large variety of milk-based sweets. The lungi (a length of cloth wrapped around the lower half of the body, comparable to the Malaysian sarong) with a short vest is the most common form of male attire in the countryside and in the less-wealthy sections of urban settlements. Men of the educated classes prefer light cotton trousers called pajamas (from which the English word originates) and a kind of collarless knee-length shirt known as a panjabi. On more formal occasions they dress in a modification of the Western suit. The traditional sherwani and churidar, calf-length tunic and close-fitting trousers, are still seen at weddings, where they are worn along with the turban. The sari is common among women, but girls and younger women, especially students, prefer the shalwar kamiz, a combination of calf-length shirt and baggy silk or cotton trousers gathered at the ankles.  "},{"CountryName":"Barbados","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life Most cultural facilities are located in Bridgetown. The Barbados Museum was established in 1933 and offers permanent and temporary exhibits covering the natural history and culture of the island. Nearby is the Barbados Art Gallery, which houses the national collection. The National Library Service, which comprises a main library in Bridgetown and several branches, has its origins in the early 19th century. There are a number of special libraries at educational institutions, government ministries, and other facilities. The Barbados Department of Archives holds primary historical documentation from public and private sources. The country has dramatic groups, schools of dancing, and art exhibitions. Barbadian writers of international reputation include George Lamming and Kamau Brathwaite. Music is a popular pastime in Barbados. The country hosts a popular annual jazz festival (January). One of the countrys cultural traditions is Crop Over, an annual multi-week summer festival that has its historical origins in sugarcane harvest celebrations. The harvest celebrations died out in the mid-20th century, but Crop Over was reborn in the 1970s as a festival of musical (notably calypso), culinary, and other arts. Crop Over culminates in the Grand Kadooment, a carnival parade that features elaborately costumed bands. Cricket is the national sport, and Barbados contributes many players to the West Indies team, which is known throughout the world. International Test matches are often played at Bridgetowns Kensington Oval (the country hosted the International Cricket Council World Cup final in 2007). Garfield Sobers and Frank Worrell are two of Barbadoss cricketing legends. The first cricket team was formed in 1877 for white players only, but teams of all races soon sprang up. Other popular recreations are sailing, surfing, snorkeling, and swimming. Road tennis, originally played on little-traveled streets with a wooden paddle and a de-fuzzed tennis ball, is believed to have been invented on the island. Barbados first sent athletes to the Olympics in 1952 and first participated as an independent country in 1968. Daily and weekly newspapers and a number of tourism-related periodicals are published. A wide range of newspapers and magazines from other Caribbean countries, the United States, Canada, Britain, and Europe can be bought or consulted in libraries.  History Little of the islands prehistory is known, but archaeological investigation indicates that it may have been settled as early as 1600 bce by people from northern South America who later disappeared from the archaeological record. From about 500 to 1500 ce, Arawak and Carib people probably lived on the island, which they called Ichirouganaim. The first contact with Europeans may have occurred in the early 16th century, when Spaniards visited Barbados. Portuguese explorers also touched on the island, which they named Barbados (Bearded Ones), either for bearded fig trees or bearded men on the island. The island was depopulated because of repeated slave raids by the Spanish in the 16th century; it is believed that those Indigenous people who avoided enslavement migrated to elsewhere in the region. By the mid-16th centurylargely because of the islands small size, remoteness, and depopulationEuropean explorers had practically abandoned their claims to it, and Barbados remained effectively without a population.  British rule An English expedition of 1625 assessed the potential of the island, and on February 17, 1627, the ship William and John landed with 80 Englishmen and about 10 Africans. The early period of English settlement was marked by the insecurity resulting from infrequent provision of supplies from Europe and the difficulty in establishing a profitable export crop. This was complicated by bitter squabbles over the claims of rival lords proprietors and over the question of allegiance to either the British crown or Parliament during the constitutional conflicts of the 1640s that led to the English Civil Wars. As in the earlier cases of Bermuda and Virginia, an assembly made up of owners of at least 10 acres (4 hectares) of freehold land was established in Barbados in 1639. Elections were held annually. There were also a council and a governor who was appointed first by the lord proprietor and, after the 1660s, by the king. The economy of the early colonial era was marked by a pattern of family farms and by a diversity of products including aloes, fustic (a dye-producing wood), indigo, and, above all, cotton and tobacco. The search for a profitable export crop ended in the 1640s, when Dutch assistance enabled the colonists to convert to sugar production. The Sugar Revolution, as it is called, had momentous social, economic, and political consequences. The elite in Barbados chose a form of sugar production that yielded the greatest level of profitbut at great social cost. They decided to establish large sugarcane plantations, cultivated by oppressed labourers from West Africa, who were brought to the island and enslaved in accordance with a series of slave laws enacted from 1636 onward. Society in Barbados was composed of three categories of persons: free, indentured, and enslaved. Race was a central determinant of status. There were three racial, or ethnic, groupswhites, coloureds (those of part-European and part-African parentage or ancestry), and Blacks. Some whites were free and some were indentured; some coloureds were free and some were enslaved; and some Blacks were free and some were enslaved. No whites were enslaved. There was a twofold population movement between 1640 and 1700. Many small family farms were bought up and amalgamated into plantations. Consequently, there was a significant emigration of whites to Jamaica and to the North American colonies, notably the Carolinas. At the same time, the Royal African Company (a British enslaving company) and other traders of enslaved people were bringing increasing numbers of African men, women, and children to toil in the fields, mills, and houses. The ethnic mix of the population changed accordingly. In the early 1640s there were probably 37,000 whites and 6,000 Blacks; by 1684 there were about 20,000 whites and 46,000 Blacks; and in 1834, when slavery was abolished, there were some 15,000 whites and 88,000 Blacks and coloureds. In European markets, sugar was a scarce and therefore valuable commodity, and Barbadian sugar planters, particularly in the 17th century, reaped huge profits out of the early lead that the island established in sugar production. Increasing wealth brought consolidation of political power for a planter elite, and Barbadian society became a plantocracy, with white planters controlling the economy and government institutions. Though enslaved people continually resisted their bondage, the effective authoritarian power of the enslaving planters ensured that, apart from a major slave rebellion in 1816 that was put down by the local militia and British troops, there was no effective threat to their control. Sugar remained ascendant in Barbados even through the 19th-century crises caused by the emancipation of enslaved people, free trade, and competition from the European beet sugar industry. This was mainly because a dense population provided cheap labour and because the political power of the white planters and merchant elite ensured that government resources would be used to rescue the industry in any emergency. The workers therefore carried the burden in low wages and minimal social services. This situation encouraged emigration (often frustrated by the elite) and occasional, futile political protests. By the 1930s the social and political pressures from below could no longer be contained. Population increase, the closing of emigration outlets, the economic effects of the worldwide Great Depression, and the spread of socialist ideology and the Black nationalist movement of the Jamaican leader Marcus Garvey had created conditions for a labour revolt. By then, middle-class reformers had begun to agitate against the restricted political franchise (the right to vote was limited to males and restricted by income and property qualifications) and the inadequate social services. Out of a series of labour disturbances of 1937 emerged a clear challenge to the existing order. The British governments response assisted this successful challenge. The West Indies Royal Commission (Moyne Commission), dispatched in 1938 to report on social and economic conditions in the British West Indies, endorsed some of the political and social reforms that were advocated by the leaders of the new mass organizations, particularly the full legalization of trade unions and the extension of the political franchise. The implementation of these reforms during the 1940s provided the essential base for the institutionalization of mass political organizations, which became the principal means through which the elites political power was curtailed. In Barbados Black political leaders gained ascendancy by 1944, universal adult suffrage was adopted in 1950, and full internal self-government was achieved in 1961.  "},{"CountryName":"Belarus","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Cultural milieu Little survives in Belarus of the earliest period of settlement by east Slavs. A distinctively Belarusian culture began to emerge clearly only in the 16th century. As Belarusian culture developed, however, long periods of foreign controlfirst by the grand duchy of Lithuania and the kingdom of Poland, then by tsarist Russia, and later by the Soviet Unionintroduced a series of outside influences, from the European Baroque and Classical architectural styles to the cultural constraints of Socialist Realism. Yet notwithstanding the considerable efforts made by Russian tsars and Soviet rulers to suppress the Belarusian language and culture, Belarusians succeeded in preserving their distinctiveness as a people. Belarusian nationalism received a boost in 2022 when human rights activist Alex Bialiatski, who in 1986 had cofounded a group of young writers that amplified Belarusian literature and cultural thought and corresponded with a broad awakening of Belarusian national identity, won (with the Center for Civil Liberties and Memorial) the Nobel Peace Prize. Daily life and social customs Independence Day, the national holiday of Belarus, is celebrated on July 3, the date of the Soviet liberation of Minsk from German occupation in 1944. Some Belarusians, particularly opposition groups, still recognize the holidays former date, July 27the date on which state sovereignty was declared in 1990. The opposition also celebrates March 25, the date of the declaration of independence by the short-lived Belarusian National Republic in 1918. Most Soviet holidays are still commemorated, especially Victory Day (May 9), as are religious holidays, including both the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Easters. A presidential fund for culture and the arts provides for a number of annual and biannual festivals. Among the most notable festivals in Belarus are the Slavic Bazaar in Vitsyebsk, an international festival of the arts; the Spring International Music Festival in Minsk; and the Arts for Children and Youth festival. After independence the countrys total fertility rate fell below two children per childbearing woman; most families are thus small in size. Many families spend summers at dachas, or country cottages, growing local produce. The practice of mushroom picking remains very popular. Much Belarusian cuisine incorporates locally grown crops. Potatoes are a nearly ubiquitous ingredient, featured in such popular dishes as potato dumplings, potato pancakes, and baked potato pie. Other common dishes, often served with rye bread, include borsch (beet soup), pork stew, stuffed chicken, beef sausage, and meat- or cabbage-filled pastries. Well-known dairy products are a fresh cheese (tvorog) and a fermented cheese (siyr). Kvass is a traditional drink made from fermented bread, and kompot is a berry juice. Vodka is typically the alcoholic drink of choice, although beer has become popular, especially among younger drinkers. The arts Architecture BelarusCathedral of St. Sophia in Polatsk, Belarus.(more)One of the oldest surviving monuments of architecture in the country is the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Polatsk, dating from the 11th century and built in the Eastern Orthodox style. The church of Boris and Gleb (Barys and Hlyeb) in Hrodna dates from the 12th century. Most of the other early buildings that remain, mostly as ruins, are the princely stone fortresses of the 12th to 16th century. One of the best-known of these is the 13th-century White Tower in Kamyanyets. The 17th century marked the appearance of the Baroque style, which was largely linked to the eastward movement of Roman Catholicism; it is exemplified by the design of the Jesuit, Bernardine, and Bridgettine churches in Hrodna. Belarusian craftsmen played a role in extending Baroque influence farther eastward into Russia, where it was adapted as the Moscow Baroque style. By the 18th century, Classical styles predominated in Belarus, as seen in the Governors Palace in Hrodna. The ravages of World War II destroyed a large segment of the countrys architectural heritage, especially in Minsk. Because much of Minsk was reconstructed after the war, most of the architecture of the city centre reflects the grandiose Stalinist style with its Classical borrowings. Literature Literary activity in Belarus dates to the 11th century. In the 12th century St. Cyril of Turaw, venerated among Orthodox Slavs as the second St. Chrysostom, wrote sermons and hymns. In the 16th century Francisk Skorina of Polatsk translated the Bible into Belarusian and wrote extensive explanatory introductions to each book. His editions, produced in Prague (now in the Czech Republic) in 151719 and in Vilnius (Lithuania) in 152225, were the first printed books not only in Belarus but in the whole of eastern Europe. In the 17th century the Belarusian poet Simeon Polotsky (Symeon of Polatsk) was the first to bring Baroque literary style to Moscow. Modern Belarusian literature began in the first half of the 19th century with the work of Yan Chachot and Vincent Dunin-Martsinkyevich, who translated part of the Polish poet Adam Mickiewiczs epic Master Thaddeus into Belarusian. Literary classics of the early 20th century include works by the poets Maksim Bahdanovich, Ales Harun, Vladimir Zylka, Kazimir Svayak, Yanka Kupala, and Yakub Kolas and the prose writers Zmitrok Byadulya and Maksim Haretski. Many of these writers had been contributors to the influential Belarusian newspaper Nasha Niva (Our Field), published in Vilnius during the period 190616. Of crucial importance for an understanding of the Belarusian cultural predicament in the face of war and revolution are Kupalas play The Locals (1922) and Haretskis short novel Two Souls (1919). Many outstanding poets and prose writers made their mark in the 1920s, including the poets Vladimir Dubovka and Yazep Pushcha, the novelist Kuzma Chorny, and the satirist and playwright Kandrat Krapiva. Pushchas literary polemics with the poet Andrey Aleksandrovich at the end of the 1920s led to tighter political control over Belarusian cultural activities. Literature in the part of Belarus that was under Polish controluntil Soviet forces occupied it in 1939developed somewhat more freely. Two writers of note emerged from that area: Maksim Tank, author of the long poems Narach (1937) and Kalinowski (1938), and Natalla Arseneva, whose greatest poems are to be found in the collections Beneath the Blue Sky (1927), Golden Autumn (1937), and Today (1944). Most noteworthy of the writers to preserve and develop the Belarusian literary tradition in the 1940s and 50s are the poets Pimen Panchanka and Arkadi Kulyashov and the prose writers Yanka Bryl, Ivan Shamyakin, and Ivan Melezh. The 1960s marked the tentative beginnings of yet another national revival with the novels of Vasil Bykau and Uladzimir Karatkievich. Among later 20th-century writers, the poets Yawhyeniya Yanishchyts and Ales Razanov and the short-story writer Anatol Sys should be noted. Other well-known writers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries are Svetlana Alexievich, whose Voices from Chernobyl was translated into English in 2005; Volha Ipatava, a prominent poet and novelist; and the poet Slavamir Adamovich, whose poem Kill the President! led to his imprisonment in 199697. Several prominent Belarusian writers left the country in the late 20th and early 21st centuries because of the political climate. They included Bykau and Ales Adamovich, both well known for their works on the Soviet-German conflict during World War II. Music Belarus has long had its own folk music. There was also a considerable tradition of church music from the 16th century on. The development of classical music largely has been a feature of the period since World War II. Among the most notable composers is Kulikovich Shchahlow, who, like some writers, went into exile after the war. Others include Yawhen Hlyebaw, composer of the opera Your Spring (1963) and the ballet Alpine Ballad (1967), and Yawhen Tsikotski, whose works include the operas Mikhas Padhorny (193957) and Alesya (1944). There are a conservatory of music in Minsk and a national philharmonic society. Concerts are held regularly at the Nyasvizh (Nesvizh) and Mir castles, which were designated UNESCO World Heritage sites in 2005 and 2000, respectively.

Other notable attractions are the Brest Fortress, completed in 1842; the Khatyn Memorial, constructed in remembrance of Belarusian villagers massacred by Nazis; and the Stalin Line museum complex, which preserves a series of defensive fortifications used in World War II, near Zaslavl. The early home of Belarusian-born artist Marc Chagall and a small museum devoted to his paintings are in Vitsyebsk. The National Opera and Ballet Theatre in Minsk houses the countrys respected ballet and opera troupes. The National Library of Belarus was established in Minsk in 1922. In 2006 it was relocated to a new building. Sports and recreation Belarusians enjoy a variety of sports. The most popular sport is undoubtedly football (soccer); most Belarusian towns and villages boast amateur and semiprofessional teams, while larger cities sponsor professional squads that often compete internationally. Basketball also enjoys a wide following, and there are several professional teams. Other popular sports are ice hockey, athletics (track and field), gymnastics, and wrestling. Belarus has a well-organized system of sports education, with specialized childrens sports schools, undergraduate schools for physical education, a graduate sports academy, and two Olympic training centres, one of which hosted several of the football matches in the 1980 Moscow Games. These schools boast many distinguished graduates, among them weight lifter Alexander Kurlovich, tennis player Natalia Zvereva, and skater Igor Zhelezovsky. Belarusians competed on the Soviet Unions Olympic team between 1952 and 1988. At the 1972 Games in Munich, gymnast Olga Korbut earned three gold medals. At the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Belarus was part of the Unified Team, which comprised athletes from the former Soviet republics. Belarus made its solo Olympic debut at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta. In these and subsequent Games, Belarusian athletes have won numerous medals in athletics, wrestling, gymnastics, weight lifting, and rowing, among other events. Media and publishing The media are heavily controlled by the government, with some outlets serving as state organs. The main newspapers are the Russian-language SBBelarus Segodnya (Belarus Today), the presidential organ; Narodnaya Hazeta (Peoples Newspaper), the organ of the Belarusian National Assembly, issued in Belarusian and Russian; and Zvyazda (Star), in Belarusian, another state organ. The main opposition newspapers are Narodnaya Volya (Peoples Will), in Belarusian and Russian, and Nasha Niva (Our Field), in Belarusian; the government determines where these papers may be sold. Influential journals include Belaruskaya Dumka (Belarusian Thought); Neman (a reference to the river of the same name), a literary and sociopolitical magazine; and the bimonthly Arche (a nod to the Greek for beginning or authority), an independent scholarly journal. There are only a handful of Belarusian television channels, and access to Western channels is minimal. Several Russian channels broadcast in Belarus, however. Radio stations are mostly government operated. European Radio for Belarus is an independent satellite station that began operations in 2005.David R. Marples "},{"CountryName":"Belgium","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life  Cultural milieu Belgiums long and rich cultural and artistic heritage is epitomized in the paintings of Pieter Bruegel, the Elder, Jan van Eyck, Hans Memling, Dieric Bouts, Peter Paul Rubens, Ren Magritte, and Paul Delvaux (see also Flemish art); in the music of Josquin des Prez, Orlando di Lasso, Peter Benoit, and Csar Franck; in the dramas of Maurice Maeterlinck and Michel de Ghelderode and the novels of Georges Simenon and Marguerite Yourcenar (see also Belgian literature); in the films of Chantal Akerman and the Dardenne brothers; in the mapmaking of Gerardus Mercator; and in the many palaces, castles, town halls, and cathedrals of the Belgian cities and countryside. The federal structure of Belgium encourages the drawing of cultural distinctions among and between Flanders, Wallonia, and the small German-speaking minorityinstitutionalized as formally empowered communities. Through educational initiatives, language promotion, and patronage of the arts, these communities see to it that regional cultures do not lose their distinctiveness. In addition, some regions are more strongly associated with particular cultural attributes than others. Flanders is particularly noted for its visual art, and various schools of painting have arisen there. In music, avant-garde tendencies have become influential in Brussels, Lige, Ghent, and Antwerp, while Hainaut remains the centre of the classical and popular traditions.   Daily life and social customs Discover the art of making Belgian chocolates and truffles in a cooking classLearn how Belgian chocolates are made.(more)See all videos for this articleBelgiums strong tradition of fine cuisine is expressed in its large number of top-rated restaurants. The country is known for moules frites (mussels served with french fries) as well as waffles, a popular snack item. Belgian chocolate is renowned around the world and may be considered a cultural institution. Chocolatiers such as Neuhaus, Godiva, and Leonidas, among others, are internationally acclaimed for their truffles and candies sold in small, distinctive cardboard boxes. Chocolate is one of Belgiums main food exports, with the majority being shipped to other EU countries. beerGlasses of beer in a bar in Brussels.(more)Beer is Belgiums national beverage; the country has several hundred breweries and countless cafs where Belgians enjoy a great array of local brews, including the famed Trappist and lambic varieties. While the reputation of Belgian beer is often overshadowed by that of its larger neighbour, Germany, the brewing and consuming of beer within the country is a cultural institution in and of itself. Most beers have particular styles of glasses in which they are served, and a variety of seasonal brews are synonymous with various holidays and celebrations. It is also common for special brews to be created for occasions such as weddings, a tradition that is reported to have begun in the early 1900s, when nearly every village had a brewery. In many small Belgian villages, the brewer was also the mayor. Festivals focus on regional history and the celebration of the seasons. In the Walloon area there are joyous spring festivals, such as the carnivals of Binche and Stavelot; summer festivals, such as the procession of giants at Ath and the dragon battle in Mons; and the winter festivals of St. Nicholas, Christmas, and the New Year. In Flanders these festivals have become folkloric celebrations with a religious or historical character. Notable events include the Festival of Cats in Ypres, which is held once every three years and commemorates a practice from earlier centuries of tossing cats from the tower of the Cloth Hall to keep their numbers under control. (The cats helped guard textiles kept in the Cloth Hall from rodents, but once the textiles were sold, the cats tended to proliferate.) Today the festival re-creates this practice with toy cats and, more generally, celebrates cats as a species. Another popular event is the Procession of the Holy Blood; held in Brugge, it is the modern continuation of a medieval tradition of parading through the city with what was said to be the coagulated blood of Christtaken from his body after the descent from the cross. According to legend, the relic at the centre of the ceremony was brought back to Brugge by Thierry, the crusading count of Flanders, in the 12th century. Finally, marionette shows survive in the Toone Theatre in Brussels. The traditional folk culture is in marked contrast to modern forms of popular culture, which, as everywhere in the West, are dominated by television, cinema, and popular music.   The arts Stoclet HouseStoclet House, Brussels, designed by Josef Hoffmann, 1905.(more)Belgiums rich heritage makes it an artistic centre of considerable importance. The paintings of the Flemish masters are on display in museums and cathedrals across the country; Belgiums contribution to Art Nouveau is clearly evident in the Brussels cityscape, and folk culture is kept alive in a variety of indoor and outdoor museums. Among the most celebrated examples of Art Nouveau architecture in Brussels are the home of architect Baron Victor Horta, which is now a museum, and the Stoclet House, designed by Josef Hoffmann. The latter was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2009. Belgium holds several significant annual musical events, including the Queen Elisabeth International Music Competition. Belgians also have taken a foreign musical form, American jazz, and made it very much their own. The style owes much to Antoine-Joseph Sax, the Belgian-born instrument maker who invented the saxophone. Practitioners of homegrown jazz have included cabaret singer Jacques Brel, jazz harmonica player Jean (Toots) Thielemans, and the legendary Django Reinhardt, a Belgian-born Rom (Gypsy) who mastered a guitar style that wedded Duke Ellington to flamenco. Belgium teems with jazz clubs and bistros and hosts a number of respected jazz festivals each year. Belgians also played an important role in the creation of techno music late in the 20th century. Literary works produced in Flanders have a style peculiar to the region, whereas in the Walloon area and in Brussels most authors write for a larger French readership that is inclined especially toward Parisian tastes. Moreover, some works that are thought of as French are written by Belgian authors living in France, and others are by writers living in Belgium who are considered French. In Belgium the comic strip is a serious and well-respected art form that has become part of the countrys modern cultural heritage. Children throughout the world became familiar with the adventures of the boy hero Tintin, who was created by Herg (Georges Rmi) and was featured in a comic strip that first appeared in 1929. The Smurfs, created in 1958 by Peyo (Pierre Culliford), became world famous as a television cartoon series. Brussels is home to a large comic-strip museum that attracts visitors from throughout Europe.   Cultural institutions The Belgian artistic heritage is represented in major museums in Brussels, Ghent, Brugge, Antwerp, Charleroi, and Lige. Traditional art and architecture are preserved in a large outdoor museum near Hasselt. The most extensive collection of Central African art in the world is housed in a museum in Tervuren, a suburb of Brussels. The National Orchestra and the National Opera in Brussels enjoy world fame. The Museum of Musical Instruments, also in Brussels, has a fine collection. War monuments at Waterloo, Ypres, and Bastogne, among others, attract visitors and history buffs to Belgium from around the world.   Sports and recreation If Belgians could play only one sport, it probably would be football (soccer). The Royal Belgian Football Association encompasses thousands of teams and clubs. Belgians national team, known as the Red Devils, has long been a power in international competitions. Cycling too has numerous enthusiasts, many inspired by the example of Eddy Merckx, who dominated international cycling during the 1960s and 70s, winning the Tour de France and the Giro dItalia five times each. Belgium also has produced a number of Olympians, including Hubert van Innis, who won six medals in archery events at the 1920 games; Ulla Werbrouck and Robert van der Walle, who dominated womens and mens judo in the later 20th century; and swimmer Frederik Deburghgraeve, who set a world record and won a gold medal in the mens 100-metre breaststroke at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. For daily recreation, most of the major cities have accessible parks. The Ardennes and the North Sea coast are major destinations for Belgians on vacation.   Media and publishing The many daily newspapers published in Belgium are controlled by press consortiums. Among the most influential and widely read newspapers are Le Soir, De Standaard, and Het Laatste Nieuws. A German-language daily, Grenz-Echo, is published in Eupen. The majority of newspapers have some political affiliation, but only those of the socialist press are linked to a political party. Belgium has several magazines, but these face strong foreign competition. Radio broadcasting was born in Belgium. As early as 1913, weekly musical broadcasts were given from the Laeken Royal Park. Radio-Belgium, founded in 1923, was broadcasting the equivalent of a spoken newspaper as early as 1926. Belgian Radio-Television of the French Community (RTBF), which broadcasts in French, and the Flemish Radio and Television Network (VRT; formerly Belgian Radio and Television [BRTN]), in Flemish, were created as public services. Both are autonomous and are managed by an administrative council. Radio Vlaanderen International (RVI) serves as an important voice of the Flemish community in Belgium. Arthur J.M. Doucy Alexander B. Murphy  "},{"CountryName":"Belize","CulturalInfo":"Constitutional framework Belizes government is based on the British parliamentary system. The 1981 constitution provides for a bicameral National Assembly composed of an elected House of Representatives and an appointed Senate. Members of the House and the Senate both serve five-year terms. The governor-general, a Belizean national who represents the British crown, nominally appoints the prime minister (the leader of the majority party in the House) and the opposition leader (the leader of the principal minority party). The prime minister appoints the cabinet. Local government Local government consists of the Belize City Council and town boards with authority over most municipal affairs. Most villages have councils, and some Mayan villages have an alcalde (a traditional community-elected leader) with limited powers. The Mennonite community administers its own form of local government. Justice Supreme Court Building, Belize City The legal system is modeled on English common law. A chief justice heads the Supreme Court, but the Court of Appeal is the countrys highest court; both are independent of the national government. In 2001 Belize joined most members of Caricom to establish a Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), which was inaugurated in 2005. Civil and criminal cases that were heard in the Court of Appeal were brought before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, while cases regarding Caricom treaties were appealed in the CCJ. In 2009 Belize adopted the CCJ as its final court of appeal, replacing the Privy Council. Political process There is universal suffrage for Belizean citizens age 18 and older. The countrys ethnic diversity affects political issues but is not reflected in its political parties, which are not ethnically oriented. There are no restrictions on the right to organize political parties. There is little ideological difference between the two major parties, the centre-right United Democratic Party (UDP) and the centre-left Peoples United Party (PUP). Health and welfare The majority of Belizeans have access to government hospitals, clinics, and maternal, child-care, and dental facilities. Infant-mortality rates have been reduced by improved water supplies, waste-disposal systems, and disease-control and vaccination programs. Malaria, however, remains a problem. Nurses are trained locally, but there remains a shortage of doctors and dentists, especially in the rural areas. A social security program was created in the 1980s to provide pensions for senior citizens and to extend assistance to pregnant, sick, disabled, and unemployed workers and to the survivors of insured workers. Since World War II, Belizeans have created a variety of institutions to meet their social needs, including trade unions, credit unions, cooperatives, and many other nongovernmental organizations that address health care, social services, womens and indigenous rights, education, and community development. The National Trade Union Congress of Belize is an umbrella organization representing workers from different occupations. Education More than nine-tenths of the population aged 14 and older is literate. Primary schooling is compulsory between ages 5 and 12. Most schools are government-subsidized parochial (principally Roman Catholic) schools. The Mennonite community runs its own schools without government interference. One-half of primary school graduates continue on to secondary school, and only a small elite receive any form of higher education. The University of Belize (2000) in Belmopan is the countrys only full-fledged university. A centre of the University of the West Indies School of Continuing Studies (1949) in Belize City provides continuing adult education. There are also a community college, a school for arts and sciences, and Galen University, an independent school in the west of the country.Cultural life Cultural milieu Belizes small but culturally diverse population is reflected in the countrys multiplicity of ethnicities, languages, religions, cuisines, styles of music and dress, and folklore. There are many ethnically distinct communities, but people of different groups also mix in many social contexts, with the exception of the Mennonite community, which sets itself apart from other groups. Social class often determines whether Belizeans will have amenities such as a car or a television set or if their children will complete secondary school. Daily life and social customs Belizean cuisine reflects ethnicity and international influences, but corn tortillas, stewed chicken, and rice and beans are widespread staples. Other assorted fare may include Creole-style stews, barbecued chicken, beef, and pork; Mayan-style tamales (cornmeal with a chicken or vegetable stuffing that is steamed in banana leaves); and Mexican-style chilies and roasts. Typical Garifuna dishes include hudut, mashed green plantains in a fish stew steeped in coconut milk. A common dish in coastal regions is seviche. One of the game dishes is the tailless gibnut (Agouti paca; a relative of the guinea pig), called royal rat on many Belizean menus because the British press had objected to its being served to Queen Elizabeth II in 1985. Locally produced rum and beer are common, and rum is often mixed with coconut water. Soft drinks and fruit juices are popular. Among the numerous celebrations in Belize are the Christian religious holidays. Baron Bliss Day (March 9) is a national festival honouring a British resident who died while on vacation in Belize and donated his fortune to the construction of local libraries, schools, and other institutions (including the Baron Bliss Institute). St. Georges Cay Day (September 10) recalls a sea battle in 1798 off the coast of Belize between Great Britain and Spain, and Independence Day is celebrated throughout the country on September 21. Garifuna Settlement Day (November 19) commemorates the arrival in 1832 of a group of Garifuna people. The San Pedro Costa Maya Festival is a multicultural celebration that takes place on Ambergris Caye each August. "},{"CountryName":"Benin","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life French colonial rule and subsequent close ties with France have left a deep impact on all aspects of cultural life, especially among the educated segments of the population and in the southern cities. Each ethnic group also has its own centuries-old tradition, which itself often mixes with the French influence. These cultural traditions are clustered in two distinct regions, the largely Muslim north and the largely animist and Christian south. In Cotonou one finds many kinds of commercial enterprises, often with a French flavour, such as restaurants, cafs, and discotheques. Diplomats of foreign governments and many of Benins elite live in newer residential sections. There are several movie theatres and several hotels that provide entertainment. Most other towns have modern sections on a smaller scale. In other sections of the towns, however, tradition dominates cultural life. Extended families live in family compounds in distinct neighbourhoods, where they practice religious rites and celebrate festivals with music and dance. Markets where foodstuffs, clothing, and traditional medicines and arts are sold are important centres of daily life. The arts Benin bronze sculptureBenin bronze sculpture of horse and rider; in the British Museum, London.(more)Artistic traditions in Benin are very old and are represented in practically every village. Plastic art is the most prominent, as carved wooden masks representing images and spirits of the departed are made and used in traditional ceremonies. Other artistic items are bronze statuettes, pottery, appliqud tapestries recounting the history of kings of precolonial Dahomey, and fire engraving on wooden bowls, which often have religious meaning. Probably the best-known art objects are the Yoruba wooden masks called guelede from the region of Porto-Novo. Street musicians are found in various neighbourhoods, and modern dance ensembles perform at clubs. Cultural institutions An artisan village is attached to the Historical Museum of Abomey (formerly the Royal Palace). There is an excellent ethnographic museum in Porto-Novo, a historical museum in Ouidah, and the Open-Air Museum of Ethnography and Natural Sciences in Parakou. The National Library is in Porto-Novo. Art galleries are the Cultural and Artistic Centre and the French Cultural Centre, both in Cotonou, and the CAZAM in Porto-Novo. Cultural centres sponsored by the French and American governments maintain libraries and organize lectures, concerts, and other cultural activities. Recreation The national sport played by several teams is football (soccer). There is a modern sport stadium in Cotonou. Press and broadcasting Radio programs are broadcast from Cotonou in French, English, and a number of local languages. There is also a limited television service. A daily newspaper, La Nation, is published in Cotonou and is controlled by the government; there are also two other dailies and several weekly or biweekly publications. Newspapers published in Senegal and Cte dIvoire (in French) and newspapers and magazines from elsewhere may be found in bookstores and newsstands. Dov Ronen"},{"CountryName":"Bhutan","CulturalInfo":" Education of BhutanUntil the early 1960s, no formal schools existed in Bhutan except those for religious instruction. Since then considerable progress has been made in education, and primary and secondary schools have been established throughout the country. By the end of the 20th century, a policy had been adopted whereby a major portion of the annual government budget was directed toward educational programs. In the early 2010s education made up about one-fifth of the governments expenditures. Education is compulsory in Bhutan, though many of the countrys children still do not have access to public schooling. Enrollment rates have risen substantially since the late 20th century. The rate of adult literacy also increased dramatically, although in the 2010s it still reached only about two-thirds, and the rate for women was lower, with slightly more than half of women being able to read and write. Gender parity in education swelled in the 2010s, however, particularly in primary and secondary education, where girls outnumbered boys. Growing numbers of students attend the countrys various colleges, including Sherubtse Degree Collegeestablished at Kanglung in eastern Bhutan in 1983 and affiliated with the University of Delhias well as several teacher-training colleges and technical-vocational institutes.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu The three main ethnic groups of Bhutanthe Bhutia, the Nepalese, and the Sharchopdisplay considerable variety in their cultures and lifestyles. A typical Bhutia house is a two-storied structure of timber and stone with thick, pounded mud walls to keep out the cold. Livestock are kept on the ground floor, while the family lives above. Inside the house, a family will usually maintain a small Buddhist shrine in a corner. Among the livestock kept by Bhutia families is the yak, which supplies not only meat but also milk, from which butter is made for use in food preparations, in lamps, and on the shrine altar. Ordinary households may not be able to afford meat in their daily meals, however, and often rely on ema datshi, a chili and cheese stew, or kewa datshi, which adds potatoes to the mix. Both can be considered national dishes, and both are served with basmati or Bhutanese red rice. Although the Bhutia have a tradition of polyandry (marriage of a woman to more than one man), their family system is basically patriarchal, with estates divided equally between sons and daughters. Both men and women may choose whom they marry and may initiate a divorce. The Sharchop are closely linked to the Bhutia because they share a common religion in Tibetan Buddhism, though among the Sharchop there is often a strong element of the older pre-Buddhist Bon religion. The Sharchop build their houses of stone and wood, often on stilts on the hillslopes. They generally practice shifting agriculture, whereby land is cleared by burning the vegetation, is cultivated for several years, and then is abandoned in favour of another site when the productivity of the soil declines. The Nepalese of Bhutan are predominantly Hindus and have caste and family ties to Nepal and India. Because they live in the warmer climate of southern Bhutan, their houses are made of bamboo and thatch. The Nepalese do not eat beef, and some of them abstain from meat altogether. Instead, they eat the rice and curry dishes that are common among the Hindus of Nepal and India. Their caste system separates different social levels and influences the choice of marriage partners and other social relationships.   The arts The major impulse in Bhutanese art comes from Buddhism. The mystic circular pattern known as the mandala is a favourite subject. The mandala adorns the walls and ceilings of Buddhist temples and is painted, embroidered, or appliqud on the scrolls known as thangkas. One of the most popularly depicted figures is Padmasambhava, who introduced Buddhism to Bhutan, and another common theme in the visual arts is the group of eight auspicious symbols of Tibetan Buddhismthe right-coiled conch shell, the lotus flower, the eight-spoked wheel of dharma, the parasol, the endless knot, a pair of golden fishes, the victory banner, and the treasure vase. Dancing is central to most religious festivals in Bhutan, and it is used to depict the tales and legends of Buddhist history and mythology. The castlelike dzongs, with their gently tapering walls, large courtyards, and long galleries, are among the finest examples of Bhutanese architecture. Chortens, or stupas, small shrines built originally to house sacred relics, are also a common architectural sight in Bhutan; their designs range from simple square structures to large, multilayered pyramidal shapes. Bhutans metalsmiths are skilled in working with bronze, silver, and other fine metals. Their artistry is evident in statues of deities, doors and pillars of temples, bells, trumpets, swords, tables, candlesticks, rice boxes, and jewelry. Every Buddhist temple contains large, brightly painted and gilded statues of the Buddha and his saints. Songs of itinerant musicians, the overtone chanting (sometimes called throat singing) of Buddhist monks, and the sounds of long horns echoing across the valleys are all an integral part of Bhutanese music. Many of the ancient Tibetan ritual musicstypically featuring drums, cymbals, and trumpets of various sizeshave been preserved, though the instruments have been modified. For example, trumpets once made of human thighbone are today constructed of metal. Some forms of Bhutanese music, especially within the Nepalese community in the southern part of the country, are more closely related to Indian (as opposed to Tibetan) traditions; such musics may use a flute or a harmonium, in ensemble with a drum, to accompany singing. Other common instruments of Bhutan include plucked lutes, struck zithers, and bamboo flutes. As the country became less isolated since the late 20th century, new types of music emerged. One new genre, called rigsar, blends Bhutanese, Indian, and Western elements within an international popular music idiom. Since its establishment in the last decade of the 20th century, Bhutans film industry has grown tremendously, and by 2005 the country had already produced several dozen films. Although most of the early works were heavily influenced by Bollywood and Hollywood productions, the industry soon began a process of indigenization as producers strove to emphasize local issues, imagery, and artistic idioms. Khyentse Norbu, a prominent Buddhist monk and pioneer in the development of distinctly Bhutanese film, wrote and directed The Cup, a comedy about several young Buddhist monks who are determined to watch the World Cup football (soccer) championship on television at their boarding school, and Travellers and Magicians (2003), filmed entirely in northern Bhutan, which depicts the struggles of a young Bhutanese man who longs to leave his country for a glamorous life abroad; both films won multiple awards at international festivals.

Karan Dawa Norbu  "},{"CountryName":"Bolivia","CulturalInfo":"Education, health, and welfare Primary education for children 6 to 13 years of age is free and officially compulsory, although school attendance is difficult to enforce in some areas. Secondary education, lasting up to 4 years, is not compulsory. At the end of the 20th century about four-fifths of the primary-age children were attending school, but the attendance rate among secondary-age children was much lower, only about one-fourth. Most education is state-supported, but private institutions are permitted. Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish organizations also maintain schools. Adult literacy rates have climbed dramatically since the 1950s, when most Bolivian Indians were illiterate, to about four-fifths of the adult population by the end of the century. The nations eight state universities are located in each of the departmental capitals except Cobija (capital of Pando department), and there are numerous private schools, including a Roman Catholic university. The largest institutions of higher learning are the University of San Andrs (founded 1930) in La Paz and Major University of San Simn (1832) in Cochabamba. There are three levels of health services: those supported by the state through the Ministry of Public Health and Social Security, those provided by the social security system for its affiliates, and private clinics. In general, medical services and hospitals are adequate in the cities but not in rural areas, where doctors and nurses are scarce but respiratory diseases and malnutrition are common. Traveling health workers provide care in colonization zones (the Valles and Oriente), where diseases such as malaria and the deadly Chagas disease (which is carried by the vinchuca bug) are major problems. Several foreign aid organizations have helped institute programs to reduce the infant mortality rate, which is still among the highest on the continent, and provide basic care to rural and poor communities. Folk medicine thrives in some rural areas, such as the Kallawaya Indian communities of the Apolobamba range.Cultural life Traditional culture Carnival celebration, Oruro, BoliviaPre-Lenten Carnival celebration in Oruro, Bolivia, with dancers performing a diablada, typically featuring caricatures of devils, their mistresses, Inca rulers, and slave drivers.(more)Bolivian society embraces a mixture of diverse and extraordinarily rich native Indian cultures as well as the Iberian culture brought by the Spaniards. On religious feast days, for example, pre-Columbian rites are practiced in conjunction with Roman Catholic celebrations, and Aymara, Quechua, and other ethnic groups express themselves through dances and songs that blend indigenous and European influences. During such festivities, symbolic dress shows the Indian interpretation of European attitudes: the dance of the palla-palla caricatures the 16th-century Spanish invaders, the dance of the waka-tokoris satirizes bullfights, and the morenada mocks white men, who are depicted leading imported African slaves. Some highly embroidered and colourful costumes imitate pre-Columbian dress. Many costumes are accompanied by elaborate masks made of plaster, cloth, or tin cans and topped by feather headdresses. The mixture of cultures is also revealed in the music and in the charango, a hybrid instrument that is similar in shape to a guitar, although much smaller; its five double strings resonate on a sound box made from an armadillo shell or a gourd. Other common instruments are the zampoa (panpipes), quena (kena; a notched vertical flute), and percussion instruments of various sizes, including skin drums, bronze gongs, and copper bells. In the lowlands of Santa Cruz and Beni departments, music composed in the 18th centuryduring the heyday of the Jesuit missions in Latin Americais performed by Guaran Indians of the Guarayo, Chiquitano, and Mojeno communities. Highland Indian women in both urban and rural areas still wear traditional multilayered skirts (polleras) and colourful shawls. The shawls may be stuffed with goods being taken to market or with fresh purchases, extra clothing, and a baby, all in a carefully balanced bundle on the back, leaving both hands free. Hats always complete the outfit, their dozens of shapes varying with the different regions of Bolivia and with the marital status of the wearers; for example, in the Quechua town of Tarabuco (near Sucre), single women wear woolen hats, whereas married women don leather hats of a completely different style. Indians long attempted to imitate Europeans, in custom as well as in dress. However, beginning in the 1940s and especially since the early 70s, Indian culture and values have been reestablished: traditional music has risen to a higher standard, painters have abandoned the imitation of European fashions, and some of the characteristics of Indian culture have reemerged in the general lifestyle. "},{"CountryName":"Bosnia-and-Herzegovina","CulturalInfo":"Markers not found in Cultural life section"},{"CountryName":"Botswana","CulturalInfo":" Government and society  Constitutional framework Under the 1966 constitution (since amended), Botswana is a multiparty republic. The president, who serves as the head of state and government, is indirectly elected to a five-year term and limited to 10 years in office. The National Assembly is composed of elected members (elected by universal adult suffrage) and a handful of ex officio members and appointed members nominated by the ruling political party; all members serve five-year terms. The Ntlo ya Dikgosi (House of Chiefs) serves in an advisory role on matters of legislation pertaining to tribal law and custom. It is composed of permanent members (representing each of the eight Tswana tribes) and members who are selected to serve a five-year term. Botswanas judicial system consists of a High Court, a Court of Appeals, and several Magistrate Courts.   Local government Local councils, rural and urban, have been elected since 1969 simultaneously with national parliamentary elections. The power of local councils is limited by the right of the central government to nominate ex officio voting members and by central government appointment of supervisory district commissioners and planning staff.   Political process Since independence Botswana has held free elections every five years and maintained a relatively uncorrupt bureaucracy and judicial respect for human rights and the rule of law. The government has also distributed increasing resources widely if not always equally among the people. The ruling party, first elected in 1965 and reelected at five-year intervals since then, is the Botswana Democratic Party. Its overwhelming majorities in elections have been based on rural support; opposition parties have drawn their strength generally from urban areas. The Botswana Peoples Party was the main opposition in the 1960s, when urban areas were small. The Botswana National Front later became the main opposition, growing in strength especially on urban councils from the 1970s until 1998, when some members left to form the Botswana Congress Party; since then both parties have served as the primary opposition to the ruling party.   Health and welfare Botswana has a dry and warm climate generally conducive to good health. The incidence of tropical diseasesnotably malaria, bilharzia (schistosomiasis), and sleeping sicknessis limited by the environment and lack of surface water. The most common fatal diseases are intestinal (diarrheal and digestive diseases) and respiratory (pneumonia and tuberculosis). Some threats to health are diseases associated with changing lifestyle, particularly diet. There has been an increased incidence of high blood pressure, strokes, and heart disease, as well as dental caries in older children. The spread of AIDS has had a devastating effect in Botswana, where the rate of infection has been one of the highest in the world; late in the first decade of the 21st century, about one-fourth of the adult population was infected with HIV, and the growing number of AIDS orphans loomed as a serious social problem. The government mounted an aggressive response, increasing HIV/AIDS awareness and coordinating efforts to curtail the epidemic. In 2002 Botswana became the first African country to provide free HIV antiretroviral medication to all citizens. Since 1973 government health policy has been based on the provision of basic health services in the form of health posts (small primary care facilities) in every village with a population of more than 500 and clinics in every area with more than 4,000 in a 9-mile (14.5-km) radius. Since the late 1980s there has also been extensive investment in two large national referral hospitals, at Gaborone and Francistown. There has been an increase in the number of private medical services and clinics, which has corresponded with the growth of the urban upper class. The use of government health services, which used to be free of charge, is now generally available for a nominal fee. There are also a number of Western-certified physicians in private practice and many traditional herbalists, healers, and diviners.   Housing Families in rural villages used to live in traditional compounds, usually with two or three small houses of cylindrical clay walls and conical thatch roofs, set around an open fireplace and surrounded by low clay walls. Many houses in the northwest were made of reed. Most houses built since the mid- to late 20th century are rectangular, with metal roofs.   Education Since independence, enrollment at all levels of education has increased steadily, and by the 21st century almost half the adult population had completed primary schooling. Enrollments in primary education are still lower in the remote western and northwestern districts than in other areas of the country, however, as poorer non-Tswana children often miss out on school. International interest has been aroused by an alternative system of education, integrating vocational skills into the secondary curriculum, developed by the educationist Patrick van Rensburg at Swaneng Hill near Serowe. But his system of education with production has had little impact on the general curriculum within Botswanas schools. A university campus in Gaborone, founded in 1976, became the University of Botswana in 1982. Officially, more than four-fifths of the population is considered literate. Rural literacy rates are higher in the east and northeast and lower in the west and northwest.   Cultural life The cultural life of Botswana reflects the dual heritage and intermingling of Tswana and English cultural domination. The two languages and cultures are subtly mixed and alternated in urban and official situations. Western dress has been general among people in Botswana, except at the poorest level, since the late 19th century. Rites of burial, marriage, and birth have been adapted to Christianity and remain extremely important in Botswana life. Football (soccer) is the national sport, played on fields and in stadiums across the country every Saturday. Common diet and cuisine consist of sorghum and corn (maize) porridge, beans and other pulses, and traditional spinach, supplemented by tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and cabbage usually purchased from stores. Meat consumption has become more common with the opening of small butcheries selling beef. Traditional foods include dried phane caterpillars from mopane woodland, eaten as relish or snacks, fruits such as the wild morula plum, and beer made from sorghum or millet. Traditional music, based on stringed instruments, and dance generally declined during the colonial period. After independence there was a revival of interest, particularly in music on the radio. The best-known modern art form incorporating traditional craftwork is basketrymost of it from northwestern Botswanawhich is widely exported overseas. The author Bessie Head (193786) wrote novels in English that reflect the contemporary realities and history of Serowe. The publishing of fiction in Tswana was revived in the 1980s. There is a national museum and art gallery in Gaborone and an increasing number of district museums founded by local community initiative. A national learned and scientific society, the Botswana Society, holds regular lectures and publishes an annual journal and books. The government issues a free daily newspaper, mostly in English, and runs television and radio stations, mostly in Tswana and English. There are also several separate private weekly newspapers, with circulation in eastern towns, and private local television stations, mostly relaying broadcasts from neighbouring countries. There is no government censorship. During the 1980s three multinational publishers set up branches to generate published materials for schools.

The Portuguese culture is by far the dominant of these influences; from it Brazilians acquired their language, their main religion, and most of their customs. The Indian population is now statistically small, but Tup-Guaran, the language of many Brazilian Indians, continues to strongly influence the Brazilian Portuguese language; other Indian contributions to Brazilian culture are most apparent in the Amazon basin. African influences on the Brazilian way of life are strongest along the coast between the Northeast and Rio de Janeiro; they include traditional foods, religions, and popular music and dance, especially the samba. Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often competed withand influencedBrazilians own cultural output, and critics have argued that the nations cultural identity is suffering as a result. Despite numerous social and economic challenges, Brazilians continue to be exuberant and creative in their celebrations and art forms.  Cultural institutions So Paulo Art MuseumThe Brazilian Academy of Letters, with its headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, is generally regarded as the most prestigious of the countrys numerous learned societies. The National Library, also in Rio, was founded in 1810 with 60,000 volumes from the Portuguese royal library; it now holds millions of books and documents. Most of Brazils other libraries have limited holdings. Among the major history museums are the Museum of the Republic (1960; housed in the former governmental palace) and the National Historical Museum (1922), both in Rio, the So Paulo University Museum (1895), and the Imperial Museum (1940) in Petroplis. The So Paulo Art Museum (1947) and Rio de Janeiro Museum of Modern Art (1948) are internationally renowned. Both Rio and So Paulo have major museums of anthropology and numerous theatres. A notable institution for the performing arts is the So Paulo State Symphony Orchestra (1953; revitalized 1972), housed since 1999 in the Sala So Paulo, a renovated early 20th-century railroad station. Few of the countrys major cultural institutions are based in Braslia.   The arts  Literature Brazil has had many world-renowned literary figures whose cumulative writings are regarded by many to be richer than those of Portugal because of their variety of ethnic and regional themes. Joaquim Machado de Assis, the son of a freed slave, was a leading voice of the 19th century with his romantic novels. In the 20th century the Northeast produced a particularly wide range of superb writing, including that of Gilberto Freyre on the subject of life under slavery, Graciliano Ramoss tragedies about the drought quadrilateral, Joo Guimaras Rosas tales of survival and violence in the interior, and Jorge Amados lighthearted stories set in the cacao-growing zone of Bahia. rico Verssimos tales of southern Brazil have also been translated into many languages.

Some of Marxs landscapes have been used to set off the imaginative structures of Brazils world-renowned architect Oscar Niemeyer. Among his works, Niemeyer designed a striking array of public buildings in Braslia, in collaboration with Lcio Costa, the creator of the capitals original layout. Brazil also cherishes numerous splendid structures from its colonial and imperial past, from the tiled houses and ornate churches of Salvador to the palaces and public buildings of Rio de Janeiro. Among the most revered of these are the 18th-century churches in Minas Gerais that were adorned by facades, biblical scenes, and statues carved in soapstone by Antnio Francisco Lisboa, better known as Aleijadinho (Little Cripple). Western styles of painting began developing in Brazil in the 18th century. In the 19th century, particularly during the reign of Emperor Pedro II, the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Rio de Janeiro drove the development of Brazilian painting, which was largely influenced by Neoclassical and Romantic styles. The academy organized art collections, held exhibitions and competitions, and trained a number of Brazilian artists who specialized in the painting of landscapes and historical subjects. Among the most prominent 19th-century Brazilian painters were Victor Meirelles, Pedro Amrico, Jos Ferraz de Almeida Jnior, and Rodolfo Amoedo. In the late 19th century Belmiro de Almeida painted scenes of Brazilian daily life, influencing a trend toward realism. In the 20th century the painter Cndido Portinari was a major proponent of a uniquely Brazilian style, which blended abstract European techniques with realistic portrayals of the people and landscapes of his native land; the painter Emiliano Di Cavalcanti, a contemporary of Portinari, gained equal international renown. In 1922, seeking to break with the conservative past, Di Cavalcanti helped to organize Modern Art Week in So Paulo, which promoted a Modernist spirit in Brazilian art. Later in the 20th century, celebrated photographic collections, such as the works of Sebastio Salgado, interpreted Brazils social and natural settings. The countrys most prestigious art exhibition is the International Biennial of So Paulo (established 1951), which regularly attracts participants from more than 50 countries.

The final court of appeal for civil cases is the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of London. There also are courts of Islamic law (Sharah; Syariah in Malay), as interpreted through Shfi jurisprudence, that can appeal to the countrys Religious Council. When Syariah was first introduced, its jurisdiction was limited to personal or family matters (e.g., marriage).

Pushpa Thambipillai Mohamad Yusop Damit    Cultural life  The arts  Visual and performing arts The visual and performing arts have for centuries been a salient expression of Bruneian culture. Brunei is particularly renowned for its metalwork. Especially during the peak of the Brunei sultanates power (16th and 17th centuries), brass and silver artisans were highly valued for their craftsmanship. They produced gongs, cannons, and other articles that were often embossed with designs of serpents and other animals. Bruneian metalwork has long been an important item of trade, both within and beyond the boundaries of the sultanate. Indeed, many of the gongs that constitute ritual paraphernalia and heirloom property among the remote interior peoplesnot only of Brunei but also of Malaysian and Indonesian Borneoare of Bruneian origin. Gongs are important locally as musical instruments. The royal nobat ensemble combines a set of vertically suspended gongs with double-reed instruments (called serunai) and single- and double-headed drums to mark important palace events, such as coronations, marriages, deaths, and the reception of honoured guests. The nobat also sometimes announces the times for Muslim prayer. A nonroyal ensemble called gulintangan combines a set of seven or eight small, horizontally suspended gongs with several larger, vertically suspended gongs and one or two double-headed drums to provide music for festivals in Malay and various other indigenous communities. An ensemble of small frame drums called hadrah often is played at weddings or to receive members of the royal family in an official capacity. A popular Malay social dance is performed to the accompaniment of large frame drums, called gendang, which often are played by women.

The high golden dome of the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque (1958) dominates the skyline of Bandar Seri Begawan. It features classic attributes of Muslim architecture in its ornate domes, arches, and minarets. The mosque was built and furnished with fine materials from around the worldincluding marble from Italy, granite from China, chandeliers and stained-glass windows from England, and carpets from Saudi Arabia. In the mid-1990s another spectacular structure, the Jame Asr Hassanal Bolkiah Mosque, was built in Kampong Kiarong (near Bandar Seri Begawan) to signify the eminence of Islam in Brunei; it is the largest mosque in the country. Istana Nurul Iman, set in landscaped gardens along the Brunei River, is an enormous residential palace incorporating both Islamic and distinctly Malay architectural styles. It is the home of the sultan and also houses his prime ministerial offices.

Sports and recreation Brunei has fine facilities for a wide range of sports, including badminton, squash, tennis, field hockey, football (soccer), and aquatics, and the countrys strongest athletes are internationally competitive. Golf enthusiasts enjoy several championship courses, and polo has been popular for decades, particularly with members of the royal family; polo fields and the royal stables are located at Jerudong Park, near Bandar Seri Begawan. Ocean sports, such as yachting and windsurfing, also have a strong following. In addition to such globally recognized activities, Bruneians practice a number of uniquely Southeast Asian sportssuch as sepak takraw, a game similar to volleyball except the ball is made of rattan and is volleyed with the feet rather than the hands, and pencak silat, a type of martial art. These sports are internationally competitive within the Asian region, and Brunei has produced award-winning athletes in both events. In 1999 Brunei hosted the 20th Southeast Asian Games in Bandar Seri Begawan at the Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium, the countrys main sports venue. In 2000 the country sent its first representative to the Summer Olympic Games, held in Sydney, Australia. Main kikik, or kite flying, remains a popular pastime in Brunei. Some kikik (kite) owners aim to fly their kites to extraordinary altitudes, to lead them through spectacular maneuvers, or to keep them airborne for as long as possible. Others, however, engage in kikik battles; with the strings of their kites coated with ground glass, competitors strive to sever in midair the strings of their opponents kikik. Another local pastime is main gasing, or top spinning. Players typically throw their gasing (top) forcefully into an arena in an attempt either to keep their top spinning as long as possible or to knock their opponents tops down or out of the playing area. With gasing that can weigh some 15 pounds (7 kg), the game requires great strength, timing, and aim.

Because Bulgarias population is largely homogeneous, the degree of cultural variation even at the regional level is small. The state encourages cultural development at all levels of society and supports the dissemination of culture, particularly through schools, libraries, museums, publishing, and state radio and television. Bulgarias numerous theatre troupes, opera companies, and orchestras began fusing together into larger, more competitive units in the 1990s. Daily life and social customs From 1946 until 1990 daily life in Bulgaria was outwardly dominated by the socialist political system. A network of mass organization, controlled by the state and the Communist Party, attempted to penetrate every sphere of private life. The state sought to inculcate a new mode of thinking and manner of action based above all on the need for and benefit of social labour. Beneath the surface, however, daily life long has been dominated by a much older tradition and cultural legacy. For example, the Bulgarian family kept many of its traditional forms of organization. Many households consist of an extended family comprising parents and one of their married sonsusually the youngestor daughters. Under the communist government, religious functions were declared entirely separate from state functions. Indeed, the postwar constitution prohibited the use of religion or religious organizations for political purposes. After 1990 the Bulgarian constitution provided for religious freedom, but in practice this freedom was granted only to mainstream, registered religions. The practice of nonregistered religions was prohibited. Festivals Bulgarians participate in many festivals, including the International Folklore Festival, held early in August in Burgas; the Varna Summer International Festival, primarily a music festival, held in July; and Sofia Musical Weeks, a springtime celebration of classical music. Historical plays are popular, particularly when staged outdoors in summer against the backdrop of important monuments or buildings associated with events in the countrys history. Local festivals provide an opportunity for new musical and literary works to be performed. The blossoming of the roses in the Karlovo and Kazanlk valleys is celebrated through May and June; the oil-bearing roses are collected for the production of attar of roses, an essential oil distilled from fresh petals that is exported worldwide. "},{"CountryName":"Burkina-Faso","CulturalInfo":" Health and welfare The state of health of the Burkinab is generally poor. Most hospitals are in the larger towns, but the government has improved access to primary health care by increasing the number of village clinics. Main causes of death in Burkina Faso include lower respiratory diseases, malaria, and diarrheal diseases. Other diseases in the country include onchocerciasis, sleeping sickness, leprosy, yellow fever, and schistosomiasis. Periodic droughts have contributed to malnutrition and related diseases, especially among young children and pregnant women. Burkina Faso has a lower prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS than do many other African countries, although it is higher than the world average. The government has focused on prevention and treatment of AIDS with some success, and the prevalence rate has decreased since the beginning of the 21st century.   Education School enrollment is one of the lowest in Africa, even though the government devotes a large portion of the national budget to education. French is the language of instruction in primary and secondary schools. About one-fourth of the population aged 15 and older is literate. The primary institution for higher education is Ouagadougou University (established 1974). Research institutes in Ouagadougou offer degrees in rural engineering and hydrology. There are a polytechnic university and a college for rural development in Bobo Dioulasso. A university was established in Koudougou in 2005. Some Burkinab seek higher education in France, Senegal, or Cte dIvoire.   Cultural life Folkloric traditions are rich in Burkina Faso, reflecting the countrys ethnic diversity. The Mossi are known for creating antelope masks that reach heights of up to 7 feet (2 metres). Bobo butterfly masks and the wood carvings of the Lobi are also well regarded for their artistry. The biennial Pan-African Film Festival (FESPACO) in Ouagadougou is popular, as is the International Crafts Fair, which celebrates the countrys artisans. The National Museum (1962) in the capital city houses artifacts from the countrys diverse ethnic groups. Information about earlier inhabitants of the area can be gleaned from the ruins of a fortified settlement at Loropni, located in the southern part of the country. The ruins date back some 1,000 years and were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2009.

Wrestling is popular in the country, and Burkinab athletes have competed in the African Nations Traditional Wrestling Championship. The country has its own basketball league and an annual international cycling tour. Football (soccer), however, is by far the countrys passion. Burkina Faso boasts a highly competitive national football league, and the national team has competed in the African Nations Cup tournament. Upper Volta first sent an Olympic team to the 1972 Munich Games, although the first athletes from Upper Volta to participate in the Olympics were two javelin throwers who competed in the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics as members of the French team. The countrys first participation in the Olympics as Burkina Faso was in the 1988 Seoul Games. Pierre H. Guiguemde Myron Echenberg The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica  History  Early history Axes belonging to a Neolithic culture have been found in the north of Burkina Faso. The Bobo, the Lobi, and the Gurunsi are the earliest known inhabitants of the country. About the 15th century ce, conquering horsemen invaded the region from the south and founded the Gurma and Mossi kingdoms, in the eastern and central areas, respectively. Several Mossi kingdoms developed, the most powerful of which was that of Ouagadougou, located in the centre of the country. Headed by an emperor, the morho naba (great lord), the Ouagadougou Mossi state defeated attempted invasions by the Songhai and Fulani empires yet maintained valuable commercial links with major western African trading powers, including the Dyula, the Hausa, and the Asante.   European exploration and colonization The German explorer Gottlob Adolf Krause traversed the Mossi country in 1886, and the French army officer Louis-Gustave Binger visited the morho naba in 1888. France obtained a protectorate over the Yatenga empire in 1895, and the French officers Paul Voulet and Charles Paul Louis Chanoine (also known as Julien Chanoine) defeated the morho naba Boukari-Koutou (Wobogo) of Mossi in 1896 and then proceeded to overrun the Gurunsi lands. The Gurma accepted a French protectorate in 1897, and in that same year the lands of the Bobo and of the Lobi were annexed by the French (though the Lobi, armed with poisoned arrows, were not effectively subdued until 1903). An Anglo-French convention of 1898 fixed the frontier between Frances new acquisitions and the northern territories of the Gold Coast. The French divided the country into administrative cercles (circles) but maintained the chiefs, including the morho naba, in their traditional seats. The country at first was attached to Upper SenegalNiger (as that colony was called from 1904 to 1920; now Mali) but was organized as a separate colony, Upper Volta (Haute-Volta), in 1919. In 1932 it was partitioned between Cte dIvoire, Niger, and French Sudan. In 1947, however, Upper Volta was reestablished to become an overseas territory of the French Union, with a territorial assembly of its own. The assembly in 1957 received the right to elect an executive council of government for the territory, which at the end of 1958 was transformed into an autonomous republic within the French Community. When independence was proclaimed on August 5, 1960, the new constitution provided for an executive president elected by universal adult suffrage for a five-year term and an elected Legislative Assembly. Hubert Jules Deschamps Jean Dresch  "},{"CountryName":"Burundi","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life  Daily life, social customs, and the arts Much of Burundis rich cultural heritage, most notably folk songs and dances, was intended to extol the virtues of kingship; however, since the fall of the monarchy in 1966 (and particularly after a massacre of Hutu in 1972), such cultural expression has waned. Burundian daily life has since been conditioned by the exigencies of survival in a time of civil strife and ethnic hatred, and many important social institutions, such as the family and the village council, have lost their force, weakened by political chaos and the wholesale displacement of populations. Once widely celebrated events include the annual sorghum festival (umuganuro), the occasion for a magnificent display of traditional dances by court dancers (intore). Also participating in the festival are drummers beating the Karyenda (sacred drum), an emblem of the monarchytheir performance is intended to give both musical and symbolic resonance to this festival and to other ceremonial occasions. Government efforts to promote interethnic harmony through displays of a shared cultural heritage have been sporadic and only modestly successful. Burundian museums that celebrate the countrys heritage include the National Museum in Gitega and the Living Museum in Bujumbura, which also includes botanical gardens and animal exhibits. Throughout history, Burundians have enjoyed a tradition of expression in the visual arts. Decorated papyrus panels, which feature geometric patterns and often depict themes from Burundian legend, are prized by collectors of ethnic arts, as are Burundian-made swords and drums. Ceramic manufacture, introduced by Italian missionaries in the 1960s, has also been an important form of artistic expression, and Burundian potters have added indigenous elements to this imported medium. Other arts and crafts include basketry and beadwork. The dye usually used to colour Burundian handicrafts is derived from natural plant extracts. Burundian conversations and social gatherings often feature recitations, singing, and the exchange of jokes, proverbs, and tall tales. Only a few books have been written to date in Rundi, most of them collections of contemporary poetry and folklore. The few writers to have emerged since independencenotably the novelists Sraphin Ss, Louis Katamari, and Richard Ndayizigamiye, along with the memoirist Michel Kakoyaare little known outside the country. Founded in 1989, the National Library in Bujumbura is a repository for Burundian literature. Burundi: music and danceTraditional Burundian dancer and drummers performing in Bujumbura, Burundi.(more)Traditional activities such as drumming and dancing contain aspects of both culture and competition: the Intore Dancers, a group that celebrates national folklore, has won numerous international folk dance competitions, and drummers compete with the traditional Karyenda drums. Burundis best-known cultural export is a troupe of traveling musicians called Les Matres-Tambours du Burundi (Drummers of Burundi). This group, made up of as many as 30 percussionists and dancers, produces an energetic, polyrhythmic sound organized around the inkiranya drum. The addition of the amashako drum, which provides a continuous beat, and the complimentary rhythm of the ibishikiso drum complete the impressive sound. The group has been widely influential and has made many recordings. Burundian singer Khadja Nin has also released several recordings, with lyrics in Swahili, Rundi, and French.   Sports and recreation Since the 1990s Burundi has tried to use sports to bring together the countrys warring factions. Football (soccer) is popular, and Burundi has competed in several African Cup of Nations championships. Burundians have also excelled in athletics (track and field), none more than Vnuste Niyongabo, who won a gold medal (Burundis first medal) in the 5,000-metre race at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.   Media and publishing Access to radio and television is limited. Although the 2005 constitution provides for freedom of the press, the government still imposes restrictions. In addition, journalists have engaged in self-censorship. Le Renouveau du Burundi, a daily newspaper published in French, is owned by the government. Other periodicals are published on a weekly basis or less frequently. Ren Lemarchand Ellen Kahan Eggers  "},{"CountryName":"Cabo-Verde","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life Although five centuries of Portuguese colonial culture have dominated the islands, traditions from Africa are also present. The two are much blended in the cultural life of Cabo Verde, evidence of which is apparent in the countrys literary, musical, and artistic production. A number of the holidays celebrated in Cabo Verdeincluding Easter, the Feast of the Assumption, All Saints Day, and Christmasreflect the countrys majority Roman Catholic tradition. Other holidays include National Heroes Day, Childrens Day, and Independence Day, which are observed on January 20, June 1, and July 5, respectively.  The arts The cultural synthesis that forms Cabo Verdean artistic tradition is notable in the rich body of oral narratives known as Nho Lobo tales, for example, which include the characters of Ti Lobo and Chibinho, both of whom have their counterparts in western African folklore. Musical traditions from Africa are reborn in Cabo Verde as batuko (derived from the Portuguese verb meaning to beat), a genre that features polyrhythm and call and response performed by a group of women. European traditions are revealed in the morna, a lament comparable to the Portuguese fado, and the mazurka. Other styles include the funana, a fast-paced genre that features the gaita, an accordion-like instrument, and the finaon, often performed by women in conjunction with a batuko session. Cesaria Evora, one of Cabo Verdes most popular musicians, is famous both within the islands and abroad for her mornas and coladeras (mornas with a faster tempo). Since the late 19th century, Cabo Verde has produced some outstanding writers and poets. Between 1936 and 1960 the cultural magazine Claridade (Clarity) was the centre of an artistic movement that marked a break with Portuguese literary traditions and established a Cabo Verdean identity. Baltasar Lopes da Silva, who used the pseudonym Osvaldo Alcntara for his poetry, and Eugnio Tavares are key figures from this period. Subsequent writers have extended the movements interest in the Crioulo culture to use that language as well as Portuguese.   Cultural institutions There is an ethnographic museum of culture and history in Praia. The National Historic Archive, which contains important documents, including some that relate to the history of the slave trade, is located in Praia. Cultural influences from the colonial era are evident in the town of Cidade Velha, located on the island of Santiago. Initially founded as Ribeira Grande by Portuguese settlers in the 15th century, the town is noted for the many examples of colonial architecture found in its historic centre, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2009.    Sports and recreation Although Cabo Verdeans enjoy a variety of sports, football (soccer) is perhaps the most popular. Matches are played at all levels of society, from pickup street games with improvised balls, fields, and nets to interscholastic rivalries and competitions between the Sotavento and Barlavento islands. Interest in basketball is growing. Long-distance running, swimming, and the traditional African board game of ouri are popular pastimes. Windsurfing, fishing, cycling, golfing, hiking, mountain climbing, horseback riding, and scuba diving are common resort activities. In their various diaspora communities, many Cabo Verdeans have distinguished themselves in sports and athletic achievements, especially in football, boxing, and baseball. Cabo Verdes Olympic committee was formed in 1989 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1993. The team subsequently made its Olympic debut at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.   Media and publishing Television and radio stations offer programming in both Portuguese and Crioulo. Print media such as A Semana, Terra Nova, and Voz di Povoall issued in Portugueseare published. Freedom of the press, guaranteed by the constitution, is generally honoured. Portuguese and foreign-language books have a small but established market.   History  Early and colonial history Although there is no conclusive evidence that the islands were inhabited before the arrival of the Portuguese, cases may be made for visits by Phoenicians, Moors, and Africans in previous centuries. It was Portuguese navigators such as Diogo Gomes and Diogo Afonso, Venetian explorer Alvise Ca da Mosto, and Genoese navigators such as Antnio and Bartlomeu da Noli, however, who began to report on the islands in the mid-15th century, shortly before a plan of active colonization and settlement was launched. In 1462 the first settlers from Portugal landed on So Tiago (Santiago), subsequently founding there the oldest European city in the tropicsRibeira Grande (now Cidade Velha). Sugar was planted in an attempt to emulate the success of the earlier settlement of Madeira. Cabo Verdes dry climate was less favourable, but, with the development of the transatlantic slave trade, the importance and wealth of the islands increased. Cabo Verde served an increasingly important role as an offshore entrept with the development of the triangular trade, by which manufactured goods from Europe were traded for slaves, who were sold in turn to plantations in the New World in exchange for the raw materials produced there; with these the ships returned home. Cabo Verde was thus a centre for the trade of cheap manufactured items, firearms, rum, cloth, and the like in exchange for slaves, ivory, and gold. Cabo Verde was especially known for its pano cloths, usually constructed of six strips of fabric made from cotton that was grown, dyed dark indigo, and woven on narrow looms by slaves in Cabo Verde; the cloths were a valuable form of currency for the slave trade on the mainland. Tens of thousands of slaves were exported from the coast to the islands and then on to the New World, especially to northern Brazil. Portuguese efforts to monopolize exploration and trade along the western African coast were disrupted by those who saw the potential of the wealth of Africa for their own interests, and smuggling was rife. Although the slave trade was controlled through the crown-issued monopoly contracts, in the late 16th century the English and Spanish began to wear away the Portuguese monopoly. In addition, the prosperity of Ribeira Grande attracted pirates, who attacked the city in 1541. The English later attacked it twicein 1585 and 1592the first time under the command of Sir Francis Drake. After a French attack in 1712, it was decided to move the capital to Praia. With the transfer officially complete in 1770, Ribeira Grande began its long slow decline. The waning of the slave tradethe Portuguese rulers and merchants reluctantly abandoned the industry in 1876coupled with increasing drought slowly sapped the islands prosperity. In the early 1800s Cabo Verde experienced not only recurrent drought and famine but government corruption and maladministration as well. In the mid-1850s the islands enjoyed a period of economic optimism as the age of steam replaced the age of sail, and large long-distance oceanic vessels needed strategic coaling stations such as Mindelo could provide. As a result, Cabo Verde was briefly the site of great port activity, before the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 cut severely into this business. For the wider population there was little relief or improvement, and emigration from the islands became the norm: faced with the prospect of drought and starvation at home, the poorest Cabo Verdeans commonly traveled south to work as agricultural labourers picking bananas and cocoa beans in Sao Tome and Principe; others found maritime work on whaling ships.  "},{"CountryName":"Cambodia","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Angkor, Cambodia: Angkor Thom ruinsRuined temples at the Angkor Thom complex, Angkor, Cambodia.(more)Angkor Wat, Angkor, CambodiaOverview of Angkor Wat, a temple complex in Angkor, Cambodia.(more)See all videos for this articleBefore 1970, Cambodian culture and artistic expression were informed by the greatness of the past. The Khmer empire owed much to Indian influence, but its achievements also represented original contributions to Asian civilization. The magnificent architecture and sculpture of the Angkor period (8021432), as seen in the temple complexes at Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom, marked a high point of Khmer creativity. Following the capture of Angkor by the Tai (15th century) and the crumbling of the empire, the region underwent four centuries of foreign invasions, civil war, and widespread depopulation. It was not until the establishment of the French protectorate in 1863 that internal security was restored, the countrys borders stabilized, and efforts undertaken to revive traditional Khmer art forms. After Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953, the government placed particular emphasis on accelerating that revival. This coincided with the rapid expansion of primary and secondary school facilities and the emergence of education as the most important factor of social mobility. The leadership of Democratic Kampuchea, inspired in large part by the Peoples Republic of China, subordinated culture to its own interpretations of Marxist-Leninist doctrines. The government in Phnom Penh after 1979, however, made serious efforts to restore such traditional forms of artistic expression as Cambodian classical music, ballet, and popular theatre. Foreign aid from India and Poland was used to clean and maintain some of the temples at Angkor, which had suffered from years of vandalism and neglect. Those aspects of high culture have had to compete for peoples attention with popular music and videotapes imported from Hong Kong, Thailand, and elsewhere. Daily life and social customs The sharp contrasts that have long existed between urban and rural Cambodians have broken down to some extent. That process began in the 1970s with the displacement of more than two million Cambodians from their urban homes, and it continued with the reoccupation of urban areas after 1979 by many who originally had lived in rural regions. After 1990 those changes were accelerated by the near ubiquity of television sets in rural areasalbeit in villages, rather than in individual homesand by the penetration of globalization into the countryside. The pace of life, however, continues to be much faster in Cambodias larger cities than elsewhere in the country. Although Cambodia is impoverished, urban people tend to be better off than farmers. Salaried employment in government, industry, and Cambodias rapidly expanding service sector allows many city dwellers to own cars and motorcycles, eat fast food, and enjoy a vibrant nightlife. Outside Phnom Penh, however, rural Cambodians largely rely on bicycles, oxcarts, and sporadic public transportation, and organized evening entertainment is infrequent. Food shortages, a part of daily life in the past, have become less common with political stability and international aid. The Cambodian rural diet, however, tends to be rather monotonous, based almost solely on rice and fish. Variation comes with the garnishes used: hot peppers, mint, lemongrass, ginger, prahoc (a spiced fish paste), and red curry paste. A popular dish is ka tieu, a soup usually made with pork and rice noodles. Cambodian cuisine makes use of mangoes, papayas, bananas, durians, and other locally grown fruits. Cambodians both rural and urban celebrate distinctive festivals and holidays such as January 7 (victory over Pol Pot), Bonn Chaul Chhnam (Khmer New Year; mid-April), Paris Peace Agreement Day (October 23), and Bonn Om Touk (Water and Moon Festival; early November), which marks the annual flow reversal of the Tonle Sap. The arts Music and dance forms Angkor Wat: apsaraApsaras, celestial dancers, depicted in a 12th-century bas-relief, Angkor Wat, Cambodia.(more)Music occupied a dominant place in traditional Cambodian culture. It was sung and played everywhereby children at play, by adults at work, by young men and women while courtingand invariably was part of the many celebrations and festivals that took place throughout the year at Buddhist temples in the countryside. Traditional music ensembles, distinguished in part by their instrumentation, included various combinations of wooden flutes and reed instruments, bowed and plucked lutes, struck zithers, xylophones and metallophones, kong vong gong circles, and drums of different sizes. The players followed the lead of one instrument, often the xylophone, and improvised their own parts building from a pool of conventional melodic and rhythmic formulae. Dancing and drama were also important forms of artistic expression. The Royal Ballet in Phnom Penh specialized in the classical, highly stylized apsara dances as well as dance-dramas recounting the Reamker (Ramayana) epic and other tales. Those forms were adapted over the centuries by both the Khmer and the Thai from the ancient dances of Angkor. In the countryside other dramatic genres and folk dances were performed at festivals and weddings by wandering troupes. The national classical ballet, reconstituted in the early 1980s by a handful of surviving dancers, has become highly professional and has toured successfully abroad. King Norodom Sihanouks daughter, Princess Bopha Devi, a former star performer in the royal troupe, vigorously supported the revival of classical dance during her tenure as minister of culture at the beginning of the 21st century. The Royal University of Fine Arts has been integral to the resurrection of Cambodian classical music and dance following their virtual extermination in the 1970s. Cambodian communities abroad have also established schools and cultural institutions to help perpetuate those traditions. Although broadly valued as symbols of national and ethnic identity, Cambodian classical performing arts have little practical appeal for the younger population. Cambodian, Thai, and other Asian popular songs have a much wider audience, as do locally made digital video discs (DVDs)the typical medium through which movies are now produced and distributed in Cambodia. Among urban Cambodian males, karaoke bars are a major source of entertainment.

"},{"CountryName":"Canada","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life totem poles, British ColumbiaTotem poles from various peoples indigenous to British Columbia, Canada, in Stanley Park, Vancouver.(more)In 1951 the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters, and Sciences issued a report (what became known as the Massey Report) warning that Canadian culture had become invisible, nearly indistinguishable from that of the neighbouring United States, owing to years of American invasion by film, radio, and periodical. Henceforth, the government declared that Canadas mass media would be required to encourage Canadian contentbooks, television programs, magazines, and other locally made cultural products. By most accounts, the policy has been quite successful, though that success has largely been the result of individualnot federalefforts. In its broadest sense, Canadian culture is a mixture of British, French, and American influences, all of which blend and sometimes compete in every aspect of cultural life, from filmmaking and writing to cooking and playing sports. Other peoples have added distinctive elements to this mixture. For example, Canadas large foreign-born population is evident in the splendid and varied restaurants (notably South Asian) that line Torontos Yonge Street, Vancouvers Chinese population has given that city a tradition of folk opera and puppetry that rival those found in China, Italian is widely spoken in the coffeehouses of Montreal, and Canadas Indigenous peoples are finding a growing voice through a broad range of fine and folk arts. In 1971, 20 years after the release of the Massey Report, Canada adopted multiculturalism as official national policy, and the federal government now gives support to various ethnic groups and assistance to help individuals participate fully in Canadian society. Since the mid-20th century, economic growth has provided Canadians with greater means for practicing and enjoying the arts. Most provincial governments provide some form of financial assistance for the arts and for cultural organizations within their borders, and many have advisory and funding councils for the arts. At the national level, the Canada Council for the Arts (headquartered in Ottawa) was established in 1957. It is funded by an endowment, an annual grant from the federal government, donations, and bequests. The annual Governor Generals Literary Awards are Canadas preeminent literary prizes; they are granted to booksone in French and one in Englishin the categories of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, drama, childrens literature (text), and translation. "},{"CountryName":"Chad","CulturalInfo":"Education of ChadThe size of the country, the dispersion of populations, and the occasional reluctance to send children to school all constitute educational problems that the government is endeavouring to overcome. Less than half of the school-age population is enrolled. Missions and public education services are responsible for primary education. Secondary and technical education is also available. The University of NDjamena (formerly the University of Chad), founded in 1971, offers higher education, and some Chad students study abroad.Cultural life Chad: prehistoric cave artPrehistoric cave art, Ennedi Plateau, Chad.(more)With its rich variety of peoples and languages, Chad possesses a valuable cultural heritage. The country is famed for the rock paintings of its ancient inhabitants, which can be found in abundance in the caves and rock overhangs of the Tibesti Mountains. Especially well-preserved sites are located at Gonoa and Zouar. Terra-cotta heads and figures found at Gaou, near Lake Chad, are believed to be relics of the early Sao civilization. The countrys capital, NDjamena, has a cosmopolitan air, with lively sidewalk cafs, small bars, and discotheques. These venues are sometimes used for a modern homegrown custom called pari-match, in which a private party is staged in a rented bar or public place, with the proceeds from alcohol sales going to the host to help pay for school tuition, home repairs, and other household expenses. The city is also known for its bazaars, which sell locally produced traditional goods and crafts such as textiles, camel-hair carpets and jackets, brass ornaments, and pottery. Also located in the capital is the National Museum, which houses prehistoric and traditional artifacts. Chad has a small but well-regarded music industry. Modern Chadian musicians combine Western-influenced pop with traditional songs and instruments. Important indigenous instruments include a three-stringed lute featuring a bowl-shaped sound box covered with camel skin. By custom, only men are allowed to play these lutes. One of Chads most popular recording artists is the ballad singer Clment Masdongar, who has earned a following in the French-speaking countries of Africa and made several appearances at European musical festivals. Tibesti, a Chadian dance-music group, has also appeared internationally. The local people of Chad have long enjoyed traditional contests of strength and skill. In the south footraces have often figured in the coming-of-age rites of several groups, with courses extending to a hundred miles and more. Such races have also popularly accompanied cattle-driving festivals and other celebrations. In the hotter, drier north, camel races, archery competitions, and wrestling matches mark traditional wintertime festivals, which are still observed alongside Muslim holidays. More modern competitive sports such as football (soccer) and basketball are also popular throughout Chad, but intramural matches are rare, owing largely to the lack of travel funds and the impassability of Chads mostly dirt roads for much of the year. As a result, Chadians have not been able to field teams for many regional competitions, nor have they been able to gain the experience that comes from playing against a variety of teams. Chad made its Olympic debut at the 1964 Tokyo Games, but it has not yet won an Olympic medal. Alfred Thomas Grove The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"},{"CountryName":"Chile","CulturalInfo":" Education of ChileChiles educational system, structured along the lines of 19th-century French and German models and highly regarded among Latin American countries, is divided into eight years of free and compulsory basic (primary) education, four years of optional secondary or vocational education, and additional (varying) years of higher education. More than nine-tenths of Chileans age 15 and over are literate. Private schools, which are run by religious congregations, ethnic groups (such as German, French, Italian, and Israeli), and private educators have relatively high enrollments and cater to affluent families. Santiago: University of ChileUniversity of Chile, Santiago, Chile.(more)University education in Chile is of considerable renown throughout Latin America. The major institution is the University of Chile (originally founded in 1738), with campuses in Santiago, Arica, Talca, and Temuco. The University of Santiago of Chile and the Federico Santa Mara Technical University, in Valparaso, are technical universities patterned after the German model. Private universities are the Catholic University of Chile in Santiago, the Catholic University of Valparaso, the University of the North in Antofagasta, the University of Concepcin, and the Southern University of Chile in Valdivia.   Health and welfare Social welfare and labour legislation evolved earlier in Chile than it did in other Latin American countries, and they have reached a high level of development. Legislation was passed in the early part of the 20th century that regulated labour contracts, workers health, and accident insurance. In successive years the social security system expanded in an attempt to cover all labour sectors. All workers were eventually covered by the Social Insurance System, maintained through contributions of employers, employees, and the state. In 1973 the military government changed social security into an individual savings scheme in which workers invest in private companies. The success of this investment system caused it to continue into the 21st century, and it has served as a model for other Latin American countries. Health care also developed remarkably during the first half of the 20th century by means of state health plans managed by the National Health Service, a subsidiary of the Ministry of Public Health. An increasing number of facilities, equipment, and qualified personnel have reduced morbidity and infant mortality, eradicated tuberculosis, and brought infectious diseases under control. A movement by the Pinochet government to modify the state-administered public health system by introducing a profit-oriented private health system began in 1980. It offered the option of private health care to those who could afford it. At the beginning of the 21st century, government health insurance covered two-thirds of the population, including those who were unemployed.   Cultural life Discover about the threshing day traditions in a small Chilean villageLearn about threshing-day traditions in a Chilean village.(more)See all videos for this articleLanguage and a common history have promoted cultural homogeneity in the country. Even the Araucanians and certain Aymara minorities in the north share the values of the Chilean identity, while continuing to cherish their own cultural heritage. Chileans have always displayed a high degree of tolerance toward the customs and traditions of minority groups, as well as toward Christian and non-Christian religious practices. The flavour of local custom and tradition in Chile is readily observable in the numerous colourful religious festivals that take place at various localities throughout the country. Hundreds of thousands of spectators are drawn to these processions.  The arts Literature, poetry in particular, is the most significant of the creative arts in Chile. Two Chilean poets, Gabriela Mistral and Pablo Neruda, won the Nobel Prize for Literature (1945 and 1971, respectively), and the poetry of Vicente Huidobro and Nicanor Parra, also of the 20th century, is recognized in the world of Hispanic literature. Fiction, on the other hand, has not been a successful genre, perhaps because of its marked parochialism. Manuel Rojas enjoyed, during the 1950s and 1960s, a degree of international popularity, and in the late 20th century the novels of Isabel Allende became highly acclaimed not only in Latin America but also, in translation, in Europe and North America. Much of the fine and performing arts of Chile is centred in Santiago, and the main season for cultural events is between March and November. One of the most-famed Chilean musicians was pianist Claudio Arrau. Composers such as Enrique Soro and Juan Orrego are noted in the Latin American world of music, but they never achieved world recognition. The Chilean National Symphony Orchestra and several chamber music ensembles keep European musical culture alive in Chile. Dance and opera are highlighted by the Municipal Ballet and Opera and the National Ballet of the University of Chile. Contemporary folk music, particularly tonadas (poetic tunes accompanied by guitar), had its halcyon days in the 1960s and early 1970s, when protest and social-content songs were fashionable. Violeta Parra, who died in 1967, excelled in that style. Santiago in particular is a hub of art galleries where the works of Chiles artists are displayed and sold. The country, however, has produced few artists of high acclaim. The painter Roberto Matta Echaurren and the sculptor Marta Colvin are among those of significance.   Cultural institutions The country, and Santiago in particular, is rich in museums of fine arts; modern, folk, colonial, and pre-Columbian art; natural history; and Chilean national history. The Museum of National History is of particular note, and others include the Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Museum of Natural Science, all in Santiago. The main library, the National Library of Chile, ranks among the largest in Latin America.  "},{"CountryName":"China","CulturalInfo":" Education of ChinaThe educational system in China is a major vehicle for both inculcating values in and teaching needed skills to its people. Traditional Chinese culture attached great importance to education as a means of enhancing a persons worth and career. In the early 1950s the Chinese communists worked hard to increase the countrys rate of literacy, an effort that won them considerable support from the population. By the end of that decade, however, the government could no longer provide jobs adequate to meet the expectations of those who had acquired some formal schooling. Other pressing priorities squeezed educational budgets, and the anti-intellectualism inherent in the more-radical mass campaign periods affected the status and quality of the educational effort. These conflicting pressures made educational policy a sensitive barometer of larger political trends and priorities. The shift to rapid and pragmatic economic development as the overriding national goal in the late 1970s quickly affected Chinas educational system. The Chinese educational structure provides for six years of primary school, three years each of lower secondary school and upper secondary school, and four years in the standard university curriculum. All urban schools are financed by the state, while rural schools depend more heavily on their own financial resources. Official policy stresses scholastic achievement, with particular emphasis on the natural sciences. A significant effort is made to enhance vocational training opportunities for students who do not attend a university. The quality of education available in the cities generally has been higher than that in the countryside, although considerable effort has been made to increase enrollment in rural areas at all education levels. The traditional trend in Chinese education was toward fewer students and higher scholastic standards, resulting in a steeply hierarchical educational system. Greater enrollment at all levels, particularly outside the cities, is gradually reversing that trend. Primary-school enrollment is now virtually universal, and nearly all of those students receive some secondary education; about one-third of lower-secondary graduates enroll in upper-secondary schools. The number of university students is increasing rapidly, though it still constitutes only a small fraction of those receiving primary education. For the overwhelming majority of students, admission to a university since 1977 has been based on competitive nationwide examinations, and attendance at a university is usually paid for by the government. In return, a university student has had to accept the job provided by the state upon graduation. A growing number of university students are receiving training abroad, especially at the postgraduate level. The system that developed in the 1950s of setting up key urban schools that were given the best teachers, equipment, and students was reestablished in the late 1970s. The inherently elitist values of such a system put enormous pressure on secondary-school administrators to improve the rate at which their graduates passed tests for admission into universities. In addition, dozens of elite private schools have been established since the early 1990s in Chinas major cities. Six universities, all administered directly by the Ministry of Education in Beijing, are the flagships of the Chinese higher educational system. Three are located in Beijing: Peking University (Beijing Daxue), the leading nontechnical institution; Tsinghua (Qinghua) University, which is oriented primarily toward science and engineering; and Peoples University of China, the only one of the six founded after 1949. The three outside Beijing are Nankai University in Tianjin, which is especially strong in the social sciences; Fudan University, a comprehensive institution in Shanghai; and Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshan) University in Guangzhou (Canton), the principal university of South China. In addition, every province has a key provincial university, and there are hundreds of other technical and comprehensive higher educational institutions in locations around the country. The University of Hong Kong (founded 1911) is the oldest school in Hong Kong. The damage done to Chinas human capital by the ravages of the Great Leap Forward and, especially, by the Cultural Revolution was so great that it took years to make up the loss. After the 1970s, however, Chinas educational system increasingly trained individuals in technical skills so that they could fulfill the needs of the advanced, modern sector of the economy. The social sciences and humanities also receive more attention than in earlier years, but the base in those disciplines is relatively weakmany leaders still view them with suspicionand the resources devoted to them are thin.

Social security programs include health and maternity benefits, workers compensation, and allowances for those unable to work. As in most Latin American countries, housing is in short supply, a problem that is especially serious in large cities, which attract a large migrant class that settles in slums. The Housing Institute addresses the problem, directing the construction of housing for the low-income rural and urban population. The Ministry of Public Health seeks to arouse the interest of individual communities in seeking solutions to health problems through independent efforts. Projects include the construction of systems to supply drinking water; public education in the matters of basic sanitation, home maintenance, balanced diet, and personal cleanliness; and the control of industries and organizations whose operations might be hazardous to health. Malaria and dysentery are common health problems in the rural areas, particularly in the poorly drained lowlands, and there are occasional cholera epidemics. Hookworm is troublesome in the damp environments of the shaded cafetales, or coffee plantations. Yellow fever, once of serious concern in the port cities, has been eradicated. Although health conditions have improved, serious problems still exist, especially among the poor and in remote areas, including problems caused by malnutrition.   Cultural life  Cultural origins lime containerLime container (poporo), gold, Quimbaya culture, Colombia, 1st7th century; in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. The poporo was used in pre-Columbian ceremonies involving the chewing of coca leaves with lime powder. The powdered lime stored in these bottles was produced by grinding heated seashells.(more)Geography has played a critical role in shaping Colombian culture, particularly in regard to regional isolation. Prior to the arrival of the first Europeans in the 16th century, the aboriginal populations of the area that was to become Colombia had achieved a high level of cultural development. Because they built largely of wood and occupied a tropical area of generally moderate to high rainfall, they left little evidence of their achievements. All groups had some form of social organization, but, except for the Chibcha of the Cordillera Oriental, they were organized in small chiefdoms (cacigazcos) under chiefs (caciques) whose authority was sharply limited geographically. Agriculture, pottery making, and weaving were all but universal. Some groupsfor example, the Chibcha, Quimbaya, Tairona, Sin, and Calimahad developed great skills in metalworking (especially goldsmithing), sculpture, and ceramics. The San Agustn culture, centred in the headwaters area of the Magdalena River, left giant anthropomorphic figures carved of stone that have been an enigma for archaeologists. While groups of Caribbean origin were warlike and practiced ritual cannibalism, others from the interior possessed a rich mythology and a religion that upheld ethical standards and norms on questions of private ownership and the prevention of crime. Until the mid-1970s it was thought that no indigenous group had left any large architectural monuments such as those erected by the Aztecs, Mayas, or Incas. The excavation, beginning in 1976, of a 1,500-acre (600-hectare) city apparently built about 900 ce by the Tairona in the Santa Marta massif, however, marked a turning point in the study of Colombias prehistory. The Andean indigenous people, particularly the Chibcha, practiced sedentary agriculture and were able to offer but small resistance to the Spanish invaders. They became the great biological and cultural contributors to the process of racial amalgamation, or mestizaje. The low demographic density of the pre-Hispanic population and its swift destruction during the colonial period led to the formation of a rather open society and to the substitution of Hispanic forms of culture for the indigenous ones. The most widely used native language, Chibcha, virtually disappeared in the 18th century.

Malaria has been virtually eliminated except in the border areas with Nicaragua; waterborne diseases are rare; and mortality rates are low. The incidence of cancer and heart disease has risen, however. Costa Ricas Social Security Institute, founded in the 1940s, is often considered a model for other Latin American countries. A number of agencies promoting human rights have established headquarters in San Jos, including the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights. The Arias Foundation for Peace and Human Progress, created in 1988 by scar Arias Snchez following his receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize, lobbies for gender equity and equal opportunity and peace and security and includes a higher education and research division. Education The constitution provides for free and compulsory education. The central government oversees school attendance, curricula, and other educational matters. About one-fourth of the countrys budget is allocated to education, and more than nine-tenths of the population is literate. School attendance is relatively high, with more than nine-tenths of children age 6 to 11 enrolled in primary schools and more than three-fifths of students age 12 to 16 enrolled in secondary schools. The University of Costa Rica (1941) has a well-planned, functional main campus in San Pedro, a suburb of San Jos, as well as a number of branches in outlying cities; the National University has a smaller campus in Heredia; and the open university, Universidad Estatal a Distancia (1977), offers courses by television from offices in San Jos. The Autonomous University of Central America (1976) is also located in San Jos, as are several private institutions of higher education. Through the initiative of Pres. Rodrigo Carazo Odio (197882), Costa Rica became the home of the University for Peace in 1980. The Technological Institute of Costa Rica (Instituto Tecnolgico de Costa Rica [ITCR]; founded in 1971 in Cartago) provides engineering and other technical training. Scores of foreign universities maintain exchange programs with Costa Ricas universities.Cultural life Cultural milieu Most Costa Rican diversions are cosmopolitan rather than nationalistic in nature. Ticos attend films with great frequency, enjoying international cinema. They listen to an extraordinary variety of music, especially from the many radio stations in the country. Cable television enables them to keep up with global events. Residents of the Valle Central attend the National Theatre, where the music played and the drama performed may come from any part of the world. Extended family and other personal connections through school, business, political, or religious associations are very important to ticos. As a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Costa Rica observes many holy days and feasts. Among the most important are Semana Santa, or Holy Week, when most of the countrys towns suspend business for several days of ceremonies and parades, and the Day of the Virgin of Los Angeles (August 2), which honours Costa Ricas patron saint and is marked by fireworks and feasting. On a secular level, Juan Santamara Day (April 11) celebrates the patriotic heroism of the young drummer boy who, according to the traditional account, set fire to a building housing the troops  of the invading American filibuster William Walker, thereby deciding the outcome of the Second Battle of Rivas, on April 11, 1856, but who died in the process. (Some historians question the details of that narrative.) The Guanacaste region, in Costa Ricas northwest, is known for raising cattle, and in late July several of its towns hold fairs that feature bullfighting, dancing, equestrian competitions, and cavalcades. Celebrations in San Jos draw crowds to its unique collection of plazasnotably the Democracy, Culture, Free Elections, and Social Guarantees plazas. The arts Costa Ricans take a strong interest in their pre-Columbian art, which includes large stone statues from the Pacific northwest of the country, exquisitely carved stone spheres (probably cemetery markers) from the Pacific southwest region, and fine figurines of gold and jade. The fine arts have seldom flourished in Costa Rica, but they have received some impetus from government support, particularly with the creation in 1970 of the Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports. Painting, sculpture, and music all showed considerable development in the latter part of the 20th century. Particular pride was taken in the growth of the National Symphony Orchestra since 1971, with the ensemble playing large halls and also taking music to the countryside. Costa Ricans have been marginally active in the field of literature. Roberto Brenes Mesn and Ricardo Fernndez Guardia were widely known in the early 20th century as independent thinkers in the fields of education and history, respectively. Fabin Dobles and Carlos Luis Fallas have attracted international attention as writers of novels with social protest themes. Carmen Naranjo is one of several noted female writers. Among the folk arts, Costa Rica is most famous for its highly decorated oxcarts and wood carvings.

Dijana Pletina Liz David-Barrett   Daily life and social customs With a predominantly Roman Catholic population, Croatia observes Catholic religious holidays. Other important national holidays commemorate historical events. Anti-Fascist Resistance Day, June 22, marks the formation of the first Partisan unit in Croatia in 1941. Statehood Day, June 25, celebrates Croatias declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Independence Day, marking the day in 1991 on which Croatia formally broke with Yugoslavia, is October 8. Croatian cuisine is heavily influenced by Turkish, central European, and Italian cuisine. Typical dishes are cabbage leaves stuffed with minced meat, evapii (rolls of seasoned grilled meat), dumplings, and pickles. Along the coast, fish is served with blitva, a dish of Swiss chard mixed with potatoes and crushed garlic in olive oil. There are also local delicacies, such as cheese from the island of Pag and wine from any number of good-quality small producers, particularly in Dalmatia. Liz David-Barrett   The arts Croatians take pride in their literary tradition, which dates to about 1100, with the dedication of the Baka Tablet (Baanska Ploa), a stone monument inscribed with Glagolitic script that was found in the 19th century on the island of Krk. The first printed book in the Croatian language was Hrvojes Missal, a liturgical text printed in 1483. Among the 20th-century giants in Croatian literature are the much-translated novelist, poet, essayist, dramatist, polemicist, and critic Miroslav Krlea (18931981) and the lyric poet, essayist, and translator Tin Ujevi (18911955), both of whom treated psychological and sociopolitical struggles at individual and universal levels.

His works include many religious reliefs and figures carved in walnut. Metrovi designed his own house in Split, now used as a museum for his works. Croatian visual artists also have been active in several other genres. Hundreds of painters and photographers are represented in galleries throughout the country, and traditional Croatian arts, including fine textile and lacework, can still be seen. Croatian naive painting, through a simple depiction of the timeless concerns of men and women, struck a universal chord in the mid- to late 20th century and brought worldwide fame to its main exponents, Ivan Generali, Ivan Rabuzin, and Ivan Lackovi-Croata. Film enjoys a particularly important place in contemporary Croatian culture. The Zagreb school of film animation has acquired world renown and recognition, including an Academy Award in 1961 for Duan Vukotis animated film The Substitute. Since 1972, Zagreb has periodically hosted an international animated film festival. Acclaimed Croatian filmmakers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries include Dejan orak, Krsto Papi, and Zrinko Ogresta.

In addition, the traditional kolo dance is still performed at weddings and festivals. Zagreb, Split, and Dubrovnik teem with nightclubs that showcase local musical talent. Tereza Kesovija, arguably Croatias most famous singer, first received acclaim in the 1960s as a singer of French chansons.

"},{"CountryName":"Cuba","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life Cuban culture has undergone a major transformation since the revolution, and the government has come to play a leading role in it. Since the creation of the Ministry of Culture in 1976, this role has expanded to include a network of professional and amateur cultural organizations throughout the country. Cultural institutions before 1959 were generally limited to Havana (and, to a lesser extent, the provincial capitals) and were almost entirely privately endowed. Before 1959 Cuba had some 100 libraries and a half-dozen museums; today it has approximately 2,000 libraries and 250 museums located throughout the country. The Ministry of Culture directs a program of education in music, visual arts, ballet, dramatic arts, and modern dance, culminating in the university-level Higher Institute of Art. More than 200 neighbourhood cultural centres (casas de cultura) offer workshops in all branches of the arts.  Daily life and social customs In general, Cuba is a country short of everything, though its people exhibit extraordinary resilience and inventiveness in the face of hardship. So skilled are they, for example, at keeping automobiles from the 1950s in good running and cosmetic condition that Cuba has become a destination of choice for vintage-car collectors from the United States and Europe. Still, the constant food shortages, electricity blackouts, and telephone breakdowns affect people in different ways. Most problems and opportunities are relative and constantly changing, except for the staples of life in Cubathe inescapable control of the government, the Saturday-night movies on one of the two local television channels, the Monday-night telenovelas (soap operas) imported from Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, or Colombia, and the unavoidable preoccupations of work, home, and family. Socialist ideologies notwithstanding, lifestyles are not equal for everyone, and how one perceives Cuba varies considerably depending on ones individual situation. Groups with access to hard currencymainly U.S. dollarsenjoy a level of comfort not markedly different from that of middle-class residents elsewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean. From two-fifths to half of Cubans have access to dollars. This is a varied group indeed, comprising recipients of foreign remittances from their families, workers in service industries who receive gratuities, tourist enterprises catering to foreigners, members of the armed services, workers in some industries who are paid partly in dollars, and even those working in the sex trade. There is also a group, locally called mayimbes (bosses), who appear to enjoy a good life without the benefit of obvious employment. These people form the faithful local clientele at the upscale paladares, the family-style restaurants officially licensed since 1994; they also frequent elegant state-run restaurants and the international dining rooms, expensive boutiques, and disco clubs of some first-class hotels, as well as the Caracol and Cubalse dollar stores scattered throughout Havana and other resort towns. Dollars also enable ordinary Cubans to ameliorate, however slightly, the monotonous routine of their lives. They can supplement the inadequate supplies of their ration booksnot only in quality but also in quantity and varietyfrom purchases in the mercados agropecuarios (general food markets) and creative private sources (including the black market). caf cubanoCaf cubano (Cuban coffee), a shot of Cuban espresso that is sweetened with demerara sugar as it is brewed.(more)The typical cuisine makes wide use of pork, fowl, and ricecooked with a scarcity of spicesand tropical fruits. Popular dishes include moros y cristianos (black beans and rice), ajicao (a stew of meat and vegetables), and lechn asado (roast pig), consumed with dark coffee and locally produced lager. For family and personal entertainment, the cinema remains extremely popular, and Havana hosts one of the largest film festivals in Latin America each year. In Havana and Santiago drama groups have regular performances. A small number of clubs, like the Casa de Amistad (Friendship House) in Havana, cater to tourists and Cubans of modest means by supplying good food and a lively ambiance. Music and dance remain an important part of Cuban life. A variety of classical and popular musical groups offer weekend performances, and many kinds of music are heard on the streets, especially along the Malecn, Havanas seaside promenade that remains a magnet for youths, especially in the evenings and on weekends. Music is also an integral part of the Afro-Cuban religion Santera, which has contributed much to the culture of the island. Franklin W. Knight   The arts  Literature A recognizably Cuban literature first began to emerge after the end of the 18th century. In the early 19th century several writers gained prominence espousing intellectualism and the concept of freedom. These ideas gained perhaps their greatest intensity in the writings of Jos Mart, a Cuban of modest Spanish background who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. He inspired an entire school of writing devoted to winning freedom from Spain. Writers whose works reflected social protest in the pre-Castro period include Nicols Guilln, a leader in founding the Afro-Cuban school of literature, and Jose Z. Tallet, both activist poets. In the 20th century short stories became the predominant prose form, but exceptional novels were also produced, such as Alejo Carpentiers Ecu-Yamba-! (1933; Lord, May You Be Praised!), which is a tribute to Afro-Cuban life and culture, and El siglo de las luces (1962; Explosion in a Cathedral, 1963), which portrays the violence and chaos wrought on the Caribbean during the French Revolution. The works of the poet, novelist, and essayist Jos Lezama Lima have also been influential. In addition, the works of the American writer Ernest Hemingway are deeply admired on the island, which was his home for many years and the setting for The Old Man and the Sea (1952) and Islands in the Stream (1970). Cuban writers such as Reinaldo Arenas, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Leonardo Padura Fuentes, and Ronaldo Menendez have earned international attention in the postrevolutionary era; however, many such writers have been exiled after falling afoul of government censors. By the early 21st century, Cuban writers had published large numbers of major novels and literary magazines.  "},{"CountryName":"Cyprus","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life  Daily life and social customs The culture of Cyprus is divided between the northern Turkish and the southern Greek sections of the country. Since 1974 the Turkish community in northern Cyprus has promoted its own Turkish and Islamic culture, supporting its own newspapers and periodicals and changing many place-names to Turkish. The anniversary of the proclamation of the TRNC (November 15) is celebrated in the north, as are traditional Muslim holidays. Greek Cypriots speak a dialect of Greek and maintain a somewhat ambivalent attitude about mainland Greeks. However, most Greek Cypriots who go abroad for their postsecondary education travel to Greece, and these young people share in the popular culture of Greece, which is itself increasingly cosmopolitan. Even so, Greek Cypriots take care to preserve their traditional culture and to observe such important holidays as Easter (and the pre-Easter Carnival) and Anthestiria, a spring flower festival. Despite years of civil conflict in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, the younger generation of Greek Cypriots has grown up in a relatively peaceful, settled, and prosperous society that encompasses aspects of traditional culture while welcoming world trends in dress and entertainment. These trends were introduced not only by the mass media but also by a tremendous influx of young travelers, whose presence can be felt in the dance clubs and bars that now abound throughout the island.

Geography has left Cyprus heir to numerous culinary traditionsparticularly those of the Levant, Anatolia, and Greecebut some dishes, such as the islands halloumi cheese, pourgouri (a dish of boiled cracked wheat), hiromeri (a pressed, smoked, and aged leg of pork), and sucuk (a confection made of thickened grape juice and almonds), are purely Cypriot. As in much of the Mediterranean world, the appetizer, or meze, in Cyprus plays a central role, often taking the place of the entre. Fresh fruits and vegetables are a part of every meal, and Cyprus has long been famous for its wine, viticulture having been practiced on the island for thousands of years.   The arts Cyprus has figured in the literature of Europe for thousands of years, from the works of Ionic lyric poets to modern travel memoirs such as Lawrence Durrells Bitter Lemons (1957). Literary traditions are strong on the island itself. Drawing on oral tradition, on classical formssuch as the tekerleme (rigmarole) and mani (quatrain)and on contemporary styles, Turkish Cypriot singers such as Acar Akaln and Nee Yain have developed a body of work that is well known on the Turkish mainland though largely untranslated into other languages. Contemporary Greek Cypriot poets are somewhat better known beyond the island, having been translated into other European languages. Several literary journals are published, and small presses issue hundreds of books in Greek and Turkish each year. Poetry is also an important element in the growing peace culture movement, which seeks to forge social and cultural links across the islands ethnic divide. Cypriot woman crocheting lace doiliesWoman crocheting lace doilies in Omodhos, Cyprus.(more)Numerous painters and sculptors work in Cyprus, and the Cultural Services office keeps the states collection of modern Cypriot art on permanent exhibition and sponsors the annual Kypria International Festival of music and theatrical performances. In the village of Lemba, near Paphos, the Cyprus College of Art runs courses for postgraduate art students. The government encourages young composers, musicians, and folk dance groups. Both the Turkish and the Greek Cypriot communities have active film industries, and Cypriot motion pictures have received a number of awards in international competitions. Classical and folk music enjoy a wide following among Cypriots of all ages, and the respective folk music traditions of the Greek and Turkish communities, combined with international styles, have contributed to the development of native Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot popular music styles.   Cultural institutions Kourion, Cyprus: theatreTheatre at Kourion (Curium), near Limassol, Cyprus.(more)The ancient cultural traditions of Cyprus are maintained partly by private enterprise and partly by government sponsorship, especially through the Cultural Services office of the Republic of Cypruss Ministry of Education and Culture, which publishes books, awards prizes for literature, and promotes Cypriot publications. Cities have public libraries, as do many rural communities. The government-sponsored Cyprus Theatre Organization stages plays by contemporary Cypriot dramatists as well as classical works. The ancient theatres of Salamis and Soli in the Turkish sector and Kourion (Curium) in the Greek portion have been restored; a variety of plays are staged at Kourion, and a Greek theatre has been built at Nicosia. Many noteworthy buildings survive from the Lusignan and Venetian periods, in particular the Gothic cathedrals at Nicosia and Famagusta and the Abbey of Bellapais near Kyrenia. There are other Gothic churches throughout the island. Orthodox Christians also built numerous churches in a distinctive style that was often influenced by the Gothic; the interiors of these illustrate the continued development of Byzantine art. Cyprus has notable examples of medieval and Renaissance military architecture, such as the castles of Kyrenia, St. Hilarion, Buffavento, and Kantara and the elaborate Venetian fortifications of Nicosia and Famagusta. Additional sites of cultural significance include the town of Paphos, held to be the legendary birthplace of Aphrodite, which houses a temple constructed in her honour dating from the 12th century bce; the painted churches of the Troodos region, a complex of Byzantine churches and monasteries renowned for their display of murals in Byzantine and post-Byzantine styles; and the Neolithic settlements at Choirokotia, inhabited from the 7th to the 4th millennium bce. These sites were designated UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1980, 1985, and 1998, respectively.   Sports and recreation Sports play a major role in the Greek Cypriot community, as they have since Classical times, when stadiums stood at the heart of the islands chief cities. Through the Cyprus Sports Organization, an official body formed in 1969, the government has built stadiums, sports halls, and swimming pools and has subsidized associations and clubs for a wide spectrum of sports; there are a professional football (soccer) league and a semiprofessional basketball league. Cypriot athletes began to compete in the Olympic Games in 1924 but as members of the Greek national team. In 1978 the Cyprus National Olympic Committee was admitted to the International Olympic Committee, and the Republic of Cyprus has been sending its own national teamconsisting of athletes from the Greek Cypriot sector onlyto the Games since 1980. There have been unsuccessful attempts at athletic cooperation or contests between the Turkish and Greek communities, and international sports-governing bodies have not recognized the sports associations in the Turkish sector of Cyprus.   Media and publishing Television and radio are controlled in the Greek sector by the semigovernmental Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation and are financed by government subsidies, taxes, and advertising. Throughout the island, broadcasts are in Greek, Turkish, English, and Armenian, and daily and weekly newspapers are published in Greek, Turkish, and English. The Turkish sector receives broadcasts from Turkey. Herman W. Goult David Wathen Stather Hunt John S.

Aggressive public health programs are directed against the threats of infectious diseases. Public health nurses provide free advice and assistance to mothers, which, with good nutrition and housing, has contributed to a low infant mortality rate. The vast majority of the cost of the health care system is paid for by national and local authorities and employers. Danish citizens may choose between two primary health care options. Most Danes opt for completely free care that is provided by a general practitioner; some, however, prefer to pay a portion of their medical bills out of pocket for the privilege of choosing any family physician or specialist they wish. Additional, private health insurance also is available. Denmarks comprehensive social welfare system offers unemployment, disability, old-age, and survivorship benefits at virtually no charge to all Danes. According to the Danish constitution, Any person unable to support himself or his dependants shall, where no other person is responsible for his or their maintenance, be entitled to receive public assistance. The state welfare programs of Denmark should not be thought of as institutionalized charity, however. They are recognized both legally and in public opinion as morally just social rights that have been paid for by taxes and assessments. Education Education in Denmark is free, and virtually the entire adult population is literate. Nine years of school attendance for children ages 7 to 16 is compulsory. Preschool and kindergarten education is optional but available to all children. After reaching the 9th grade, students may leave school to enter the workforce, but the majority continue their education. Some undertake vocational or training programs, while others enroll in a general upper secondary school (gymnasium) or another institution offering a higher preparatory education. While many graduates of these schools subsequently enter the workforce, many others continue on to universities or to schools and academies of university rank that specialize in technical and artistic fields. Some Danes choose to attend Danish folk high schools, which were first established in the 19th century and continue to offer nonformal educational programs to adults. At the pinnacle of higher education are the University of Copenhagen (founded in 1479), the University of Aarhus (1928), and the University of Southern Denmark (1966), all state supported. Additional universities were established at Roskilde in 1972 and at lborg in 1974.Cultural life Daily life and social customs Danes traditionally faced life from the security of the nuclear family, as has been true throughout Europe, but during the late 20th century, substantial changes took place. For example, marriage lost its status as an almost inevitable social institution. In earlier centuries the Danes easily tolerated sexual relations between individuals who were engaged to be married, and it was not uncommon for marriage to take place after a baby was bornalthough it was considered immoral and unacceptable not to marry eventually. By the early 21st century, however, cohabitation without the formalities of engagement and wedding was quite common, and nearly half of all live births took place out of wedlock. Consistent with the decline of contracted marriages, the incidence of divorce also rose. In addition, in 1989 Denmark became the first country to establish registered partnerships for same-sex couples, which offered the same rights and duties as marriage. "},{"CountryName":"Djibouti","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Djibouti is renowned for its delicate multicoloured textiles, which are made into saronglike garments called futa. These garments are sold in the capitals colourful central market. The cuisine of Djibouti mingles African and French influences to produce meals that might include roast lamb with a delicate yogurt sauce, lentil stew, flatbread, and cucumber salad, served with mineral water and fruit juice. The souk (marketplace) of Djibouti city is famed for its spicy oven-baked fish. The capital also houses several high-quality Vietnamese, Chinese, and Lebanese restaurants, making it a somewhat remote but altogether fascinating destination for gourmands. Muslim feasts and holidays, including d al-Fir, which marks the end of Ramadan, and d al-A, which marks the culmination of the hajj, are celebrated by Djiboutis predominant Muslim population. In addition to these, other major holidays in the country include Independence Day, which is celebrated on June 27. The arts and cultural institutions Among students of literature, Djibouti is best known for having been the sometime home of the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, who lived in Djibouti for several years. Rimbaud lends his name to a cultural centre housing a small library and museum, on the grounds of which an annual music festival takes place. This festival draws performers from all over the country, and live recordings of headliner acts have proved popular with international audiences. Among the best-known performers are the Soukouss Vibration Band, Dinkara, Adarous, Pre Robert, and Passengersthe last a Rastafarian group that performs reggae tunes by Bob Marley and other Jamaican artists, with lyrics translated into the Somali language. The government sponsors several organizations dedicated to the preservation of traditional culture and dance. Sports and recreation Athletics is a major component of Djiboutian society. The most popular sport in Djibouti is running, and during the 1980s Djiboutian runners enjoyed a considerable amount of success. Ahmed Salah, the most accomplished Djiboutian marathoner, won several international events, including the first world marathon championship in 1985. Football (soccer) has long been popular as a spectator sport. The Djiboutian national team participated in its first international competition in 1998. Tennis is developing a following, although access to tennis courts and equipment remains limited. Ptanque is also extremely popular. Similar to bocci ball, the game features players who take turns rolling a ball as close as possible to a target ball. Every night around the city, groups of Djiboutians play ptanque under the streetlights. Other sports favoured in Djibouti include volleyball, handball, basketball, and judo. Volleyball and handball each have active leagues, but basketball is less organized, largely because of the lack of suitable courts. Djibouti made its first Olympic appearance at the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. Its runners have had strong showings, and, at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, Salah won the countrys first medal, a bronze in the mens marathon. Media and publishing Djiboutis only television and radio broadcast company, which offers programming in French, Arabic, Afar, and Somali, is state-run, as is the daily French-language newspaper, La Nation. Independent publications include La Renouveau and La Rpublique, which are both weeklies.Catherine C. Cutbill Peter J. Schraeder History This discussion focuses on Djibouti since independence. For a more detailed treatment of earlier periods and of the country in its regional context, see eastern Africa, history of. Independence and the Gouled presidency (197799) Balancing ethnic tensions On June 27, 1977, the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became independent, taking the name Djibouti, with Hassan Gouled Aptidon as president. On the eve of independence, Djiboutis viability as a sovereign state was questionable. However, fears that the Afar and the Issa Somali would become pawns in a struggle between the republics rival neighbours, Ethiopia and Somalia, did not materialize. No Djiboutian political leader, either Afar or Somali, ever condoned unification with either of the larger states. Indeed, Djibouti established a peaceful international profile through a policy of strict neutrality in regional affairs. In keeping with friendship treaties with both Somalia and Ethiopia, the government refused to support armed groups opposing the neighbouring regimes, and it hosted negotiations between Somalias and Ethiopias leaders that resulted in a series of accords in 1988. Djiboutis balanced posture in external relations was reflected in its internal politics. Gouled, an Issa Somali, was elected to two consecutive terms as president in 1981 and 1987. Barkat Gourad Hamadou, an Afar serving as prime minister since 1978, was reappointed in 1987. Power appeared to be shared, with ministry appointments following a formula designed to maintain ethnic balance. In the first years of self-government, though, ethnic tensions were evident. By 1978 the state had experienced two cabinet crises and changes of prime minister. Those ousted were Afars accused of fomenting ethnic strife. After opposition parties were banned in 1981, ethnic conflict in the political arena was for the most part minimal. However, Issa predominance in the civil service, the armed forces, and the Popular Assembly for Progress (Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progrs; RPP)now the only legally recognized political partywas only slightly masked, and occasional tremors of social unrest disturbed Djiboutis superficial calm. Urban development and challenges Challenges to Djiboutis stability could not be reduced to traditional Afar and Issa enmity; signs of the serious problems facing the young nation were also to be found in the urban demography of its capital. On the outskirts of the city, an expansive squatter community known as Balbala, which originally developed just beyond the barbed-wire boundary erected by the French colonial administration to prevent migration to the capital, tripled in size within a decade after independence. In 1987 it was officially incorporated into the city, with the promise of development of basic water and sanitary services. Its growth continued because of a high birth rate, rural migration, and displacement of persons from the urban core. Conditions in some of the densely populated quarters of Djibouti city were only marginally better than in Balbala. Structures were limited to wood and corrugated iron by colonial, and later national, restrictions on the construction and location of permanent dwellings. Distinct ethnic enclaves were identifiable: the retail centre surrounding the main mosque (Hamoudi Mosque) and the former caravan terminus (Harbi Square), housing the Arab community; the neighbourhoods radiating beyond this area, settled by the Isaaq, Gadaboursi, and Issa Somali; and the quarter known as Arhiba, built by the French to house the Afar dockworkers recruited from the north of the colony in the 1960s. As the urban infrastructure was developed, and as government-subsidized housing was realized through international aid programs, conditions in the old districts of the city improved. Yet the needs remained immense, and progress was accompanied by perceptions of ethnic favouritism. Discontent was also fostered by a high cost of living, unemployment, and a widening gap in living conditions between the majority of the population and the new urban elite. "},{"CountryName":"Dominican-Republic","CulturalInfo":" Justice of the Dominican RepublicThe legal system is based on the Napoleonic Code. A nine-member Supreme Court is the final court of appeal. The Senate appoints Supreme Court justices, who in turn appoint judges to lower courts, which include courts of appeal and provincial, municipal, commercial, and land courts. The constitution of 2010 provides for a Constitutional Tribunal to rule on constitutional matters. Separate military tribunals hear cases involving members of the armed forces. The constitution stipulates the independence of the judiciary; however, the president and other members of the government have frequently influenced court decisions. Public confidence in the judicial system has long been undermined by corruption, the inadequate legal training of some judges, and the routine preemptive detention of suspected criminals. As is the case in some other Latin American nations, the vast majority of prisoners are held without a trial, sometimes for years.   Armed forces and police During the Trujillo regime the armed forces were used to preserve the dictatorship, and afterward the military continued to play a role in politics; however, in the 1990s the government placed the military under civilian control, reduced its size and budget, and attempted to make it more professional in character. As a result, the militarys political influence diminished moderately, but its senior officers continued to guard its institutional privileges. The police force is organized on a national basis and is sometimes seen as a rival to the army. Detective work is carried on by the National Department of Investigations (Departamento Nacional de Investigaciones; DNI), whereas narcotics laws are the focus of the National Drug Control Directorate (Direccin Nacional de Control de Drogas; DNCD). Both the DNI and the DNCD include members of the police and military. Corruption, extrajudicial killings, and participation in drug trafficking are major concerns within the nations security forces, although the nation has worked closely with the United States on drug interdiction.   Education Primary education is officially free and compulsory for children between the ages of 7 and 14, although those who live in isolated areas have limited access to schooling. Primary schooling is followed by a two-year intermediate school and a four-year secondary course, after which a diploma called the bachillerato is awarded. Relatively few lower-income students succeed in reaching this level, because the system is designed to encourage middle- and upper-income students to prepare for admittance to a university. Most wealthier students attend private schools, which are frequently sponsored by religious institutions. Some public and private vocational education is available, particularly in the field of agriculture, but this too reaches only a tiny percentage of the population. The Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, founded in 1538, is the oldest institution of higher education in the New World. It was originally affiliated with the Roman Catholic church, but in the early 19th century its religious ties were severed; the university was reorganized in 1914, and the national government now provides most of its funding. Costs are low, and even poor students may attend if they have been fortunate enough to have secured the requisite primary and secondary preparation. The government or police have occasionally interfered in the universitys operations because it has long been a source of political activism. The private Pedro Henrquez Urea National University, located in Santo Domingo, was founded (1966) in part to counter the politicizing of the public university. It received support from the Roman Catholic church, prominent business leaders, and the national and U.S. governments. Apec University (1965) is also located in Santo Domingo, whereas Central del Este University (1970) is in San Pedro de Macors. The Madre e Maestra Pontifical Catholic University (1962) is based in Santiago but also has a campus in the capital.   Health and welfare The Dominican people are generally healthier than those of neighbouring Haiti. However, unsanitary water, inadequate housing and health services, and poor nutrition undermine health conditions among the poorer classes in both rural and urban zones. As a result, infectious and parasitic diseases are common, and the infant mortality rate is high. Hospitals and trained medical personnel are available only in the larger cities and towns. In the rural areas, home remedies and traditional healers are often the only means of preserving or restoring health. Severely ill patients may be transported to a nearby urban centre, where hospitalization is free; however, most families take that measure only in extreme cases, often when death is already imminent. Leading causes of death include diseases of the circulatory system, infectious and parasitic diseases, cancer, and respiratory illnesses. Social conditions in the Dominican Republic generally resemble those of other developing nations in the Americas. The national social security system helps support the elderly and disabled, and maternity and death benefits are also provided; however, public resources are limited, and few Dominicans have additional health insurance, so the elderly and infirm often must rely on family support.   Cultural life The Dominican Republics society and culture largely reflect its Hispanic heritage; African traditions have also influenced the nation because of its slave heritage and its lengthy border with Haiti, which has a predominantly Black population. The nation developed in colonial times as a slave-plantation society, creating a castelike system divided by skin colour. In addition, past generations of Dominicans attempted to define their culture in anti-Haitian terms that implied a racist ideology, although most Dominicans have since discouraged those views. However, it is difficult to identify traditions that are uniquely Dominican. "},{"CountryName":"Dominica","CulturalInfo":"Transportation of DominicaHigh rainfall and rugged terrain have impeded road building in Dominica. The first road across the island was not completed until 1956, and it was not until 1984 that a major road-rehabilitation project was launched to greatly improve accessibility. The main airport is Melville Hall, located at Marigot, on the northeast coast. A second airport is at Canefield, near Roseau. Larger vessels use the deepwater port at Woodbridge Bay near Roseau, but Portsmouth remains the major banana-shipping port.\nGovernment and society\nConstitutional framework\nThe constitution adopted at independence provides for a president as head of state and a prime minister as head of government. The legislative branch of government, called Parliament, consists of the president (ex officio) and a single-chamber House of Assembly. Of the 32 total house members, 21 are elected from constituent districts; 9, called senators, are presidential appointees; and 1, the speaker, is elected either from among members who do not belong to the cabinet or from outside the House of Assembly. The attorney general is also considered a member of the house. The president is elected by the legislature, and the prime minister is appointed by the president from among the elected members of the House of Assembly. The prime minister heads a cabinet chosen by the president from among members of the house, although no more than three cabinet members may be senators. Terms of office are for five years, and there is universal adult suffrage.\nDominica is a member of the Commonwealth, the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Caribbean Community, and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). Dominica uses the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$), the common currency of the OECS.\nHealth and welfare\nThere are several major hospitals. Local medical needs are handled by health centres throughout the island. Intestinal diseases, diabetes, anemia, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases constitute the major health problems of Dominica.\nEducation\nPrimary education is compulsory and free in government-run schools. There are many secondary schools, a teacher-training college, a medical school, a nursing school, and a branch of the University of the West Indies. Literacy is estimated at nearly 90 percent.\nCultural life\nCarib material culture remains evident in the production and use of dugout canoes and intricate woven baskets. The Carib community underwent a cultural renaissance in the 1990s with the opening of a cultural centre in Roseau and increased tourist interest in Carib art and traditions. The governments cultural agencies have encouraged the revival of slavery-era traditions, which had almost died out, including Afro-French dances, drama, music, and costumes. France remains an important cultural influence in Dominica because of its linguistic legacy and the proximity of Martinique and Guadeloupe, and Dominicas French-influenced creole was revived in the 1980s and 90s with the publication of a dictionary and other texts. Other legacies are the predominance of Roman Catholicismunusual in a former British colonyand Dominicas French-influenced cuisine, which features local fish and vegetables.\nThe Dominica Museum, in Roseau, features exhibits on the islands natural history, economy, culture, and history. Dominica produced two well-known novelists in the 20th century, both of whom were Creole. Jean Rhys (18901979) was famous for Wide Sargasso Sea (1966), a broodingly atmospheric novel set on an island that is clearly Dominica. Her contemporary Phyllis Shand Allfrey (190886) became known for The Orchid House (1953), which tells of the physical and spiritual decadence of a white planter family in Dominica. As well as writing fiction, Allfrey was a politician, cofounding the Dominica Labour Party and serving as a minister in the West Indies Federation, and a poet, celebrating her islands natural beauty in poems such as The Childs Return.\nHistory\nBefore colonization the island was a stronghold of the Carib people who had migrated there from South America, driving out the earlier Arawak. It was named by Christopher Columbus, who sighted it on November 3, 1493, a Sunday (Latin: dies dominica, the Lords day).\nThe French and British colonial period\nHistorical map of DominicaDominica, detail of a map in the 10th edition of the Encyclopdia Britannica, 1902.(more)The first colonists (1632) were French, but, with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), Great Britain and France agreed to treat the island as neutral ground and leave it to the Caribs. From that time until 1805, Dominica went back and forth between France and Britain. French planters continued to settle in Dominica until 1759, when the British captured the island. It was formally ceded to Britain in 1763. In 1778, French forces from Martinique captured Dominica. The British recaptured the island in 1783. The French, coming that time from Guadeloupe, failed to again retake the island in 1795. The French made a final assault on the island in 1805, and, although they burned the capital, Roseau, they were forced to withdraw.\nAt first administered as part of the Leeward Islands, in 1771 Dominica was made a separate colony. It was rejoined administratively to the Leewards in 1883 and remained thus until 1940, when it was transferred to the Windward Islands as a separate colony. In 1958 Dominica joined the West Indies Federation. After that organization was dissolved in 1962, discussions for alternative forms of federation took place. Those issues were settled when the British government passed the West Indies Act of 1967, which gave Dominica the status of association with the United Kingdom. Under the 1967 constitution the island became fully self-governing in internal affairs.\n"},{"CountryName":"Ecuador","CulturalInfo":" Education of EcuadorThe network of public education has been greatly expanded to promote the goal of universal literacy. Primary education is free and compulsory for six years beginning at age six. Ecuador has made progress in making education available to disadvantaged classes and ethnic groups and to women. Religious and nondenominational private schools also play a significant role. Population growth and limited funding have placed great strains on the educational system, however. Efforts are under way to adapt the curriculum to Ecuadors cultural diversity. Secondary education varies from seriously overcrowded public institutions to elite private institutions emphasizing bilingualism in English, French, or German. The premier university is the Pontifical Catholic University in Quito, noted for its research programs in fields such as botany, archaeology, linguistics, and anthropology. It (along with other universities in Quito) attracts numerous students from the United States and Europe who participate in study abroad programs. The Polytechnic School in Quito has good programs in the sciences, as well as an outstanding centre for monitoring and studying volcanic and earthquake hazards. The Polytechnic School of the Military has outstanding facilities for technical training. San Francisco University is a private institution modeled on colleges in the United States. Numerous other universities specialize in particular areas, although the university system in general has suffered from uncertain funding and political turmoil. Many Ecuadorans seek training abroad, especially in technical fields and in business. Much research takes place outside the universities. Geographic and environmental research and postgraduate training are conducted by the Panamerican Center for Geographical Studies and Research at the Military Geographical Institute in Quito. The same building houses other environmental institutes, libraries, and laboratories. Social science institutes are also numerous, especially in Quito; they include a local unit of the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences. Agricultural research is concentrated in the laboratories of the National Institute of Agricultural Investigations. Major research establishments are maintained by French and U.S. foreign assistance organizations.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Ecuador is a country of great ethnic diversity and great contrasts of wealth and poverty (see People). People identify more with their region or village than with the country as a whole, although the government has attempted to nourish a sense of pan-Ecuadoran national identity. At a minimum, the country may be divided into a dozen major folk-cultural regions: norteo mestizo, northern Quechua, central highland mestizo, Quiteo urban, central Quechua, Cuencano mestizo, Lojano mestizo, southern Quechua, Esmeraldeo Blacks, coastal mestizo-mulatto, Shuar (Jivaro), and Amazonian Quechua. Numerous smaller or more-localized cultures also exist, and there are two culturally mixed areas in Santo Domingo de los Colorados and the northeastern Oriente. The most prominent and representative groups are the central highland mestizos and the coastal mestizo-mulatto mixed culture; both increasingly find their identities linked with the cities and urban cultures of Quito and Guayaquil, respectively.  "},{"CountryName":"Egypt","CulturalInfo":" Housing of EgyptEgypt has faced a serious urban housing shortage since World War II. The situation subsequently became aggravated by increased migration from rural to urban areas, resulting in extreme urban overcrowding. Although there is considerable concern over the housing problem, the combined efforts of both public and private sectors have struggled to meet the growing demand. Nearly three-fifths of all private investment went into residential construction during the mid-1980s. In the late 1990s, enormous resources were devoted to improving hundreds of identified slums, and nearly a score of new development areas and cities were constructed. Confounding the problem, however, was the increase in the urban population, estimated at more than two-fifths during the same period. In 2004 the available housing amounted to roughly a quarter million units, but the demand continued greatly to exceed that supply. Furthermore, many units remained vacant because they were overpriced or subject to assorted legal restrictions and other bureaucratic obstacles. In the rural areas villagers build their own houses at little cost with the materials available; however, local contractors are forbidden by law from converting valuable topsoil into bricks. The government has experimented in aiding self-help projects with state loans. Ambitious rural housing projects have been carried out on newly reclaimed land; entire villages with all the necessary utilities have been built.   Education At the end of the 19th century, there were only three state-sponsored secondary and nine higher schools in Egypt; the educational structure continued to be based on maktabs, or kuttbs (schools devoted to teaching the Qurn), for primary education, and on madrasahs (Islamic colleges) for higher education. In 1923 a law was passed providing free compulsory education between the ages of 7 and 12, although that was not fully enforced until the early 1950s. There was a sharp increase in funding for education after World War II, and following the revolution of 1952 progress accelerated. One of the most significant features of this progress has been the spread of womens education, and there has been a sharp increase in the number of women attending university. Women are no longer confined to the home; many fields of employment, including the professions and even politics, are now open to them. A further result of the expansion of education has been the emergence of an intellectual elite and the growth of a middle class, consisting of members of the professions, government officials, and businessmen. Because of advances in the provision of education services, literacy rates have gradually risen; a growing two-thirds of men are literate, while the proportion for womenthough increasing quicklyis still roughly half. There are three stages of state general educationprimary (six years), preparatory (three years), and secondary (three years). The primary and preparatory stages are compulsory for children between ages 6 and 15. Pupils who are successful in examinations have the opportunity to continue their education at the secondary level. There are two types of secondary schools, general and technical. General high schools offer a scientific, a mathematical, and a liberal arts curriculum; most technical schools are either commercial, agricultural, or industrial. Alongside the Ministry of Educations system of general education, there is that provided by the institutes associated with al-Azhar University, centred on al-Azhar Mosque (founded 970) in the old quarter of Cairo. Al-Azhar has been an Islamic teaching centre for more than 1,000 years. Instruction is given at levels equivalent to those of the state schools, but in order to allow for greater emphasis on traditional Islamic subjects, the duration of training is lengthened by one year at the preparatory stage and two at the secondary. A large-scale modernization of the college-level curriculum, making it comparable to those of other state universities, has been carried out since 1961. In the 1950s there were almost 300 foreign schools in Egypt, the majority of them French; many of these have since become, to varying degrees, Egyptianized. Pupils who attend these schools, at all levels, sit for the same state certificate examinations as those in the normal state system. The oldest state universities are Cairo (1908), Alexandria (1942), Ayn Shams (1950), and Asy (1957). More universities were added to the state system during and since the 1970s. There are also several private universities, the oldest being the American University in Cairo (1919). There are many institutes of higher learning, such as the Academy of Arts, comprising the higher institutes of ballet, cinema, theatre, Arab music, Western music, folklore, art criticism, and child care. Other institutes specialize in commerce, industry, agriculture, the arts, physical culture, social service, public health, domestic economy, and languages. Courses of study lead to a degree.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu In spite of the many ancient civilizations with which it has come into contact, Egypt unquestionably belongs to a social and cultural tradition that is Arab and Islamic. This tradition remains a constant factor in determining how Egyptians view both themselves and the world. The story of the cultural development of modern Egypt is, in essence, the response of this traditional system to the intrusion, at first by conquest and later by the penetration of ideas, of an alien and technology-oriented society of the West. This response covered a broad spectrumfrom the rejection of new ideas and reversion to traditionalisms through self-examination and reform to the immediate acceptance of new concepts and the values that went with them. The result has been the emergence of a cultural identity that has assimilated much that is new, while remaining distinctively Egyptian. The process is at work in all branches of contemporary culture.  "},{"CountryName":"El-Salvador","CulturalInfo":" Health and welfare Despite a number of governmental attempts to achieve a more equitable distribution of income through a major program of agrarian reform in the late 1970s, as well as improvements in education and social services following the war, progress in El Salvador has been exceedingly slow. Low-cost housing, medical assistance, and employment programs were improved upon in an attempt to meet the needs and problems of the displaced and the unemployed, but such programs have had difficulty keeping up with deteriorating conditions. The doctor-to-patient ratio is low, and most doctors serve only urban areas. Moreover, in many areas the war and population displacement have caused the reappearance and spread of diseases, particularly dengue fever, malaria, and cholera. Malnutrition is increasingly prevalent.   Education All public and private institutions of learning are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. Since 1968 the school system has been composed of preschool, primary, and secondary educational categories, followed by university-level education. Primary education is free and compulsory. More than four-fifths of Salvadorans aged 10 and over are literate. Among the institutions of higher education are the University of El Salvador (1841), the University Dr. Jos Matas Delgado (1977), and the Central American University of Jos Simen Caas (1965). There are also schools for technology, fine arts, agriculture, social services, and nursing.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu The cultural life of El Salvador, like its population, is an amalgam of Indian and Spanish influences, though European influences predominate, largely because most Indian cultural activities have been suppressed by the government since the 1930s. Indian customs do survive, however, in small clusters of villages, such as those around Izalco and Nahuizalco, and traditional crafts are produced in Ilobasco (pottery) and Izalco (textiles). This cultural mix also can be seen in the countrys rich tradition of folklore, poetry, and painting. The Roman Catholic Church also has been a major influence on almost every aspect of cultural life.   Daily life and social customs Owing to the large number of Salvadorans who have immigrated to, or returned from, the United States since the 1980s, the lifestyle of broad segments of El Salvadors urban population (and even that of those in many rural areas) has become increasingly Americanized. In one of San Salvadors wealthier neighbourhoods, Escaln, a number of multiscreen cinemas have opened, and the citys principal boulevard is lined with shopping malls and fast-food restaurants. On weekends North American, South American, and Mexican rock music is played in the bars. Salvadorans of all classes enjoy their countrys folk music. Although the countrys dozens of radio stations mostly play North American and Mexican popular music, there has been a revival of the cancin popular, folk music often mixed with political commentary. Cancin popular can frequently be heard playing in El Salvadors restaurants, which serve staples such as casamiento, a spicy mixture of rice and beans, and pupusas, rice- or corn-flour tortillas stuffed with a variety of fillings, including cheese, meat, and beans.   The arts El Salvadors elite have long prized the arts, especially literature.  But any kind of antigovernment literature was an extremely dangerous enterprise during the civil war years. Many Salvadoran writers, artists, and intellectuals fled the country. Few returned, but those who did, including poets Manlio Argueta and Francisco Rodriguez, gave frequent readings before large audiences. One of the countrys most widely respected poets, Roque Dalton, was assassinated in 1975 as a result of leftist internecine struggle. Private benefactors have played as important a role as that of the government in patronizing the arts. The government has increased its contribution to national cultural life, particularly in its expansion of secondary and continuing education.   Cultural institutions The majority of El Salvadors cultural institutions are located in the capital. The most significant of these are the state-supported National Theatre and the Presidential Theatre, the latter of which offers performances of works by contemporary playwrights. Museums, also in the capital, include the Natural History Museum of El Salvador and the David J. Guzmn National Museum, which specializes in history and archaeology.   Sports and recreation Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in El Salvador and is played throughout the country. Internationally renowned players include Jorge (El Mgico) Gonzlez, who is considered one of the most accomplished footballers in the history of the Central American game, and Jaime (La Chelona) Rodrguez, who, with Gonzlez, led the national teams memorable run in the 1982 World Cup. Other sports, such as baseball and boxing, are still incipient in El Salvador. Numerous adventure sports are popular, including hiking, surfing, fishing, and kayaking. The country first competed in the Olympics at the 1968 Games in Mexico City.   Media and publishing The majority of newspapers and publishing companies in El Salvador are privately owned. Major daily newspapers include the ultraconservative El Diario de Hoy (Todays Daily), the conservative La Prensa Grfica (The Graphic Press), El Mundo (The World), and the government-owned Diario Oficial (Official Daily), among others. Ren Santamaria Varela David G. Browning Markus Schultze-Kraft   History  Early history Before the Spanish arrived in Salvadoran territory in the 16th century, it was occupied by a complex of indigenous peoples. Of these the Pocomam, Chort, and Lenca, all related to the Maya, were the more ancient, but the Pipil, whose civilization resembled that of the Aztecs in Mexico, were predominant. Archaeological ruins dating from pre-Columbian times are Tazumal, Pampe, El Trapito, and San Andrs. Of several large towns founded by indigenous people, Sonsonate and Ahuachapn still exist.

"},{"CountryName":"Equatorial-Guinea","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Despite a veneer of Spanish culture and of Roman Catholic religion that is thicker in Bioko than on the mainland, many Equatorial Guineans live according to ancient customs, which have undergone a revival since independence. Among the Fang of the mainland, witchcraft, traditional music (in which the Fang harp, the xylophone, the great drums, and the wooden trumpet are used), and storytelling survive. Among the Bubi farmers of Bioko, some ancient customs are still followed as well. The various regions and communities of Equatorial Guinea each have their own typical cuisine. Spanish cuisine also has influenced the cooking of the country. Commonly used ingredients are similar to those used in neighbouring countriese.g., fish, shrimp, crayfish, pumpkin seeds, peanuts (groundnuts), and vegetables. Chocolate is used in a variety of recipes as well. One popular method of preparing fish involves wrapping it in banana or plantain leaves before cooking it over an open fire. Several Equatorial Guinean writers have gained international acclaim for their Spanish-language works. Among the most prominent of these authors are fiction writer and anthologist Donato Ndongo-Bidyogo; poet, essayist, and dramatist Juan-Toms vila Laurel; and poet and novelist Mara Nsue Ange. Athletes representing Equatorial Guinea first competed in the Olympic Games in 1984 in Los Angeles. In the 2000 Games in Sydney, swimmer Eric Moussambani drew cheers after winning a 100-metre freestyle heat; he had learned to swim earlier that year. Tourist attractions include the countrys island beaches and Monte Alen National Park, located in the continental portion of Equatorial Guinea. The parks thick tropical rainforest is home to gorillas, chimpanzees, and hundreds of species of birds. Ren Plissier Ronald James Harrison-ChurchHistory The island of Bioko (formerly Fernando Po) was sighted by the Portuguese explorer Ferno do P, probably in 1472. At first it was called Formosa (Beautiful). Annobn was probably sighted by Ruy de Sequeira on a New Years Day (hence the name, which means good year) between 1472 and 1475, most likely that of 1474. By the Treaty of Tordesillas (June 7, 1494), the Portuguese had exclusive trade rights in Africa, and it was not until 1778 that they agreed to cede to Spain the islands of Annobn and Fernando Po as well as rights on the mainland coast between the Ogoou and Niger rivers. These cessions were designed to give Spain its own source of enslaved people in Africa for transport to Spanish America, where, in exchange, the Spanish confirmed the rights of the Portuguese west of the 50 W meridian in what is now Brazil. The Spanish were soon decimated by yellow fever on Fernando Po, and they withdrew in 1781. No European occupation was made on the mainland. British administration After the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807, bases were required by the Royal Navy for the effective suppression of the trade. Fernando Po lay in a strategic situation from which the Niger mouths and the portion of western Africa known as the Slave Coast could be watched for enslavers. In 1827 the Spanish leased bases for this purpose to the British at Port Clarence (later Santa Isabel, now Malabo), a fine deepwater harbour on the north coast, and in San Carlos Bay (now Luba Bay) on the west coast. In the absence of the Spanish, the British also became responsible for administering the island. Thereafter the British resettled many formerly enslaved people there, in default of knowing their origin or of being able to repatriate them. Formerly enslaved people also came to the island from Sierra Leone and Jamaica, and in the 20th century the descendants of these several groups continued to speak a form of English. Because of the existence of these formerly enslaved people and the lack of any Spanish administration in the area, the United Kingdom made several unsuccessful offers to Spain for the purchase of Fernando Po, particularly from 1839 to 1841. In 1843 the Royal Navy concentrated its antislavery patrol at Freetown in Sierra Leone, and its buildings on Fernando Po were sold to a Baptist mission.

A railway was built by the Italians from Massawa to Asmara, Keren, and Akordat. There is an international airport in Asmara, and major airfields are located in Asseb and Massawa.Government and society Constitutional framework After liberation from Ethiopia in May 1991, Eritrea was ruled by a provisional government that essentially consisted of the central committee of the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front (EPLF). On May 19, 1993, shortly after a national referendum, this body proclaimed the Transitional Government of Eritrea. The intention was that this government would rule the country for four years, until the promulgation of a constitution and the election of a permanent government. The transitional governments legislative body, called the National Assembly, consisted of the original 30-member central committee of the EPLF augmented by 60 new members. The National Assembly elected independent Eritreas first president, Isaias Afwerki, in 1993. Following his election, Afwerki consolidated his control of the Eritrean government. As president, he was head of state and of government; he also presided over the legislature and the State Council, an executive body whose members were presidential appointees. In addition, he became commander in chief of the army and chair of the countrys sole political party, the EPLF, renamed the Peoples Front for Democracy and Justice in 1994. A constituent assembly ratified a new constitution in May 1997, but it was not implemented, and the anticipated parliamentary and presidential elections never took place. The 150-member Transitional National Assembly, an interim legislative body established in 1997, remained the de facto legislature into the 21st century, and President Afwerki maintained his powerful position. Citing national security concerns, he shut down the national press in 2001.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tBritannica Quiz\t\tCountries  Their Features\t\n Health and education Chronic drought and decades of war took a toll on the health of Eritreans in the second half of the 20th century, although conditions had improved somewhat after the first decade of independence. In the early 21st century the infant mortality rate was slightly higher than the world average but significantly lower than the African average. The average life expectancy was in the mid-50s for men and about 60 for womenabout a decade shorter than the world average for each sex. More than three-fifths of Eritreans over age 14 are literate; the male literacy rate is significantly higher than the rate among females. Children are taught in their native languages, and in the higher grades they are also taught foreign languages, especially Arabic and English. There is a university in Asmara. Cultural life The golden oldies of Tigrinya pop, a style that was popularized throughout Africa in the late 1960s by such artists as Beyene Fre, Tewolde Redda, and Alamin, remain popular in Eritrea. Contemporary popular musicians in Eritrea include Sami Berhane, Wedi Tukul, and Faytinga. Reggae, which originated in Jamaica, also has a presence in Eritrea. Eritrean cuisine has not yet gained the popularity that its Ethiopian counterpart has found in many countries around the world. The two cuisines share some ingredients, techniques, and staples, including injera, a chewy flatbread made of teff, wheat, or sorghum flour, and kitcha, an unleavened bread. Meals typically are served on a communal platter, and diners use bread, rather than utensils, to serve themselves portions of such dishes as zigni (a stew made of fish, vegetables, and meat), ful (baked beans), dorho (roasted chicken), gaat (porridge), and shiro (lentils). These dishes are seldom eaten without a side dish of fiery berbere, a locally produced pepper that figures prominently in Eritrean cooking. Eritrean food also shows many influences from the countrys erstwhile Italian occupiers, with such dishes as capretto (goat), frittata (vegetable omelet), and pasta featured on many menus. Coffee is an important ingredient of Eritrean social life. Making a good cup of coffee, Eritreans say, requires both patience and skill. The commonly accepted method of making coffee suggests the need for both: coffee beans are roasted in a skillet or oven, pounded and ground with a mortar and pestle, and then poured into a pot that is half full of cold water and, sometimes, ginger root. After the mix is boiled, it is poured through an oxtail filter and served in small porcelain cups with sugar cubes. Popcorn or other snacks may be eaten as accompaniments to the coffee. Eritreans enjoy playing sports, especially football (soccer), which was introduced during the Italian occupation. Eritreas national football team is known as the Red Sea Boys. Eritreans also participate in basketball, cycling, and athletics (track and field). Outdoor activities include fishing and snorkeling, which is especially popular on the Dahlak islands.History Precolonial Eritrea Rule from the highlands Beginning about 1000 bce, Semitic peoples from the South Arabian kingdom of Saba (Sheba) migrated across the Red Sea and absorbed the Cushitic inhabitants of the Eritrean coast and adjacent highlands. These Semitic invaders, possessing a well-developed culture, established the kingdom of Aksum, which, by the end of the 4th century ce, ruled the northern stretches of the Ethiopian Plateau and the eastern lowlands. An important trade route led from the port of Adulis, near modern Zula, to the city of Aksum, the capital, located in what is now the Ethiopian province of Tigray. After extending its power at times as far afield as modern Egypt and Yemen, Aksum began to decline into obscurity in the 6th century ce. Beginning in the 12th century, however, the Ethiopian Zagwe and Solomonid dynasties held sway to a fluctuating extent over the entire plateau and the Red Sea coast. Eritreas central highlands, known as the mereb melash (land beyond the Mereb River), were the northern frontier region of the Ethiopian kingdoms and were ruled by a governor titled bahr negash (lord of the sea). The control exercised by the crown over this region was never firm, and it became even more tenuous as the centre of Ethiopian power moved steadily southward to Gonder and Shewa. Highland Eritrea became a vassal fiefdom of the lords of Tigray, who were seldom on good terms with the dominant Amhara branch of the Ethiopian family. "},{"CountryName":"Estonia","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Cultural milieu Tallinn, EstoniaBecause Estonia sits along the divide of western and eastern Europelooking west, across the Baltic, toward Sweden, and east, across Lake Peipus, to Russiait has long been influenced by both of those cultural traditions. Traditionally, northern Estonia, especially Tallinn, has been more open to outside influences (including Germanic Christianity, the Reformation, and Russification) than has southern Estonia, which has been more insular and provincial. The Estonian nationalist revival of the 19th century helped bridge this gap to create a national culture that for a long time had the countrys agricultural heritage as common denominator. Central to that heritage was the barn dwelling, a multipurpose farmhouse that has no real equivalent in other countries (save for northern Latvia). Estonian farm families both lived and worked in these buildings, which typically included the living quarters, a threshing room (for drying grain), a threshing/work area, and sometimes animal pens. Daily life and social customs Barn dwellings are now historical curiosities, but other elements of Estonian folk culture remain alive. Although the traditional costumes that were once everyday wear began to disappear in the last half of the 19th century as a result of increasing urbanization, they are still worn for festive occasions, and song and dance remain central to Estonian identity. Traditional cuisine in Estonia includes leavened rye bread, stews, berry jams, pickled gherkins, pearl barley, potato porridge, brawn (headcheese), and salt herring, among other dishes. Holiday meals may include roast goose or pork, ale, black pudding, apples, nuts, and gingerbread. Among the main holidays are New Years Day, Easter Sunday, Labour (or Spring) Day (May 1), and Christmas (December 25), as well as the summer holidays of Victory Day (June 23; Vidupha) and St. Johns (or Midsummer) Day (June 24; Jaanipev). Celebrated February 24, Independence Day honours the 1918 declaration of independence from Soviet Russia, while the 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union is observed on August 20 and known as Restoration Day. Other national holidays commemorate the Tartu Peace Treaty of 1920 (February 2) and the Soviet deportation of some 10,000 Estonians on a single night in 1941 (June 14). The arts The scope and importance of Estonian literature have steadily increased since the period of national awakening in the 19th century. Open to cultural and literary influences of western Europe, Estonian literature developed a diversity of styles, ranging from Neoclassicism to bold experimentation. In the 20th century, Estonian writers represented three different epochs: Anton Hansen Tammsaare was the leading novelist of the former Republic of Estonia (192040);  Jaan Kross wrote in an allegorical style during the period of Soviet occupation; and  Tnu nnepalu, whose work fits comfortably in the broader European context, became internationally recognized in the 1990s. Both Estonian classics and the works of contemporary authors have been translated into many languages.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tMore From Britannica\t\tBaltic states: The conquest of Estonia and Latvia\t\n The beginning of professional theatrical art in Estonia is closely connected with the creation of the Vanemuine Theatre in Tartu in 1870. Tallinn has several theatres, including the national opera theatre, a youth theatre, and a puppet theatre. The festival Baltoscandal, which presents alternative theatre, started in Parnu in 1990. Estonian visual art came of age in the middle of the 19th century, when Johann  Kler was among the leading portrait painters. The graphic art of Eduard Wiiralt symbolized bohemian art in the country in the 1920s and 30s. The international reputation of Estonian art has grown beyond these origins with the work of sculptor Juri Ojaver, ceramicists Leo Rohlin and Kaido Kask, digital media artist Mare Tralla, and graphic artist Urmo  Raus.

In fact, the yachting events of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games were held in the waters off Tallinn. Canoeing is also popular, principally on the Vhandu, Piusa, and Ahja rivers in the southern part of the country. Bog walking is widely enjoyed, and bird-watchers frequent Estonias nature reserves. In the summer, city dwellers flee to country cottages or the countrys many sandy beaches to swim and sailboard. After Estonia entered the European Union in 2004, tourists from across the continent flocked to the countrys Baltic Sea resorts, and Tallinn became one of Europes most popular weekend getaway destinations. In winter, many Estonians cross-country ski. Other popular sports are athletics (track and field), football (soccer), and basketball. Estonia made its Olympic debut at the 1920 Games in Antwerp, Belgium. Media and publishing Estonia has a number of television stations and daily newspapers (most prominently, Today), and the FM band is crowded with radio stations. Prior to the restoration of the republic, the media were state-owned and controlled by the Communist Party, mainly through state censors. Since independence, the media have been greatly liberalized. Both deregulation and consolidation were trends of the early 21st century.Arno Artur Krna Vello Julius Tarmisto James H. Bater Aivars Stranga "},{"CountryName":"Eswatini","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life\nEswatiniUnmarried girls and young women participating in the Umhlanga (Reed Dance) in Eswatini.(more)Despite the changes wrought by the money economy, by a high degree of literacy and basic education, and by steadily improving living standards and changing life-styles, tradition continues to play an important role in Swazi society, both at the national ceremonial level and in day-to-day personal contacts. This reflects the unity of the Swazi as one nation under a traditional leader and especially their reverence for the struggle of King Sobhuza II over the 61 years of his reign to regain their independence.\nThe two main cultural events are the Incwala in December and the Umhlanga in August. The Incwala is sometimes described as a first-fruits ceremony, but, spread over six days, it is a much more complex ritual of renewing and strengthening the kingship and the nation, with songs and dances used only on this occasion. The Umhlanga, or Reed Dance, brings together the unmarried girls and young women of the country to cut reeds for the annual repairs to the windbreaks of the queen mothers village; it lasts for five days. It is also symbolic of the unity of the nation and of its perpetuation through the massed ranks of young women. Both ceremonies are held at the national capital of the queen mother.\nOther ceremonies are associated with the communal weeding and harvesting of the kings fields (and those of the chiefs) and with customary marriages. Most ceremonies are accompanied by traditional music, songs, and dancing. Musical instruments are simple in design, a kudu horn (impalampala) used for hunting or herding cattle, a calabash attached to a bow (umakweyane) for love songs, the reed flute, played by small boys while herding, and rattles made of seedpods attached to the wrists and ankles. However, more typical of the homestead nowadays are the radio and record and tape players.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nThe Swazi nation is a relatively recent political grouping, the main amalgamation of clans having taken place under Dlamini military hegemony about the middle of the 19th century. However, the record of human settlement in what is now Eswatini stretches far back into prehistory. The earliest stone tools, found on ancient river terraces, date back more than 250,000 years, and later stone implements are associated with evidence of Homo sapiens from perhaps as long ago as 100,000 years. By 42,000 years ago the inhabitants were quarrying red and black hematite ore for cosmetic purposes on the top of the Ngwenya massif (where in 1964 a large opencut mining operation was developed to exploit the rich ore deposit). This ranks as one of the worlds earliest mining and trading activities, and mining continued for many thousands of years after that. Much laterabout 20,000 years agothe archaeological record reveals occupation by the ancestors of the San hunter-gatherers, who created the distinctive rock paintings found throughout the western part of the country.\nAbout 2,000 years ago groups of Bantu-speaking peoples (Nguni, Sotho, and Tswana) moved southward across the Limpopo River. They cultivated crops, kept livestock (sheep and goats), used pottery, and smelted ironhence their designation as Early Iron Age peoples. At a later date cattle were introduced. These people are recorded at Ngwenya, where the mining of iron ore has been dated to about 400 ce. During the following centuries the more attractive areas of Eswatini were settled by these ancestors of the Nguni and Sotho clans, whom the Swazi encountered in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\nThe ancestors of the Dlamini clan were part of this southward movement, which reached the Delagoa Bay area (now Maputo) of Mozambique some considerable time before the arrival of the Portuguese in the early 16th century. There they settled as part of the Thembe-Tonga group of peoples until the mid-18th century, when, probably because of dynastic conflict, they moved southward along the coastal plain between the mountains and the Indian Oceanscourging the Lubombo, as a royal praise song puts it. Up to this time they called themselves Emalangeni, after an ancestral Langa. Later they moved westward through the Lubombo range and up the Pongola valley, where about 1770 under their king Ngwane III they established the first nucleus of the Swazi nation (bakaNgwane) near what is now Nhlangano.\nEmergence of the Swazi nation\nThis was a turbulent period in the history of southeastern Africa, when a number of major clan groupings were struggling for supremacy. Two of these, the Ndwandwe and the Zulu, located to the south of the new Ngwane homeland, constituted a serious threat to the Dlamini, who strove to establish their control over the clans among whom they had settled. Nevertheless, by the end of the century, they had achieved considerable success in assimilating some of these clans and in forging bonds with others to create a new political grouping. However, this new power base was not strong enough to ward off aggression by their southern neighbours, so about 1820 under their new kingSobhuza I, or Somhlohlo (The Wonder)they moved northward to establish a safer heartland in central Eswatini (the Middleveld). There the Dlamini consolidated their power under Sobhuza I and his son Mswati II. Part of this success must be attributed to Sobhuzas adoption of the Zulu age-group system of military organization, which created regiments across clan loyalties and which was at all times strictly disciplined. By 1860 they had extended their power through conquest and assimilation far beyond the boundaries of present-day Eswatini under Mswati II, whom later generations described as their greatest fighting king and who gave his name to the nation.\nAt the peak of their power, however, a new factor had emerged in the regional geopolitics, which over the next 40 years caused the gradual contraction of Swazi territorial and political authority. This was the competing pressure from the expanding Boer republic of the Transvaal and from the growing British imperial presence, especially after the discovery in South Africa of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1871.\nThe main destabilizing force was the stream into the country of European prospectors and concession hunters, which the Swazi were able to contain for a while but which became a flood after the kingship passed to Mbandzeni in 1875. By 1890 so many concessions had been granted for so many purposes (in addition to land and mineral rights) that practically the whole country was covered two, three, or even four deep in concessions of all kinds and for different periods. Although the Swazi maintained that these were all leasehold rights that would terminate at some future date, they had, as it later transpired, signed away their independence.\nIn 1888 the Swazi tried to regulate the new influences that the influx of Europeans had created by granting them a charter of conditional self-government subject to the royal veto. Behind the concessions scramble by individuals, however, lay the intrigue and conflict of the two white powers, the Boers and the British. The former needed a route to the sea, while the latter wanted to contain them. The area inhabited by the Swazi stood in the way, as an obstacle to be manipulated by both.\nIn 1890, under a convention between the British government and the South African Republic, a provisional government consisting of representatives of the two powers and a representative of the Swazi people was set up. In 1893 the British government signed a new convention permitting the South African Republic to negotiate with the Swazi regent and her council for a proclamation allowing the republic to assume powers of jurisdiction, legislation, and administration without the incorporation of Swaziland, as it was then known, into the republic. The Swazi refused to sign the proclamation, but in 1894 another convention was signed by the two powers, virtually giving unilateral effect to its terms. After the South African War of 18991902 all the rights and powers of the republic passed to Great Britain, and in June 1903, by an order in council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, the governor of the Transvaal was empowered to administer Swaziland and to legislate by proclamation. In 1906 these powers were transferred to a high commissioner for Basutoland, Bechuanaland, and Swaziland.\n"},{"CountryName":"Ethiopia","CulturalInfo":" Education of EthiopiaEthiopia maintains two educational systems. The traditional system is rooted in Christianity and Islam. Christian education at the primary level is often conducted by clergy in the vicinity of places of worship. Higher education, with emphasis on traditional Christian dogma, is still run by most major centres of worship, the most prominent being monasteries in the northern and northwestern parts of the country. Graduation from these centres leads to a position within the priesthood and church hierarchy. Modern education was an innovation of the emperors Menilek II (reigned 18891913) and Haile Selassie I (193074), who established an excellent, though limited, system of primary and secondary education. In addition, colleges of liberal arts, technology, public health, building, law, social work, business, agriculture, and theology were opened in the 1950s and 60s. Public education is free at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Primary education is offered for eight years and is compulsory between ages 7 and 12. Four years of secondary education, comprising two two-year cycles, follow. Primary schools are generally accessible, and there is a high rate of enrollment; in contrast, there is a shortage of secondary schools, and enrollment declines at that level. The public school system in general has deteriorated from lack of adequate funding, teaching staff, facilities, and space. Overcrowding is common. The countrys oldest university, Addis Ababa University, was founded in 1950 as University College of Addis Ababa. In 1961 it was restructured and renamed Haile Selassie I University, and in 1975 it adopted its present name. Other universities in Ethiopia include Alemaya University in Dire Dawa, Debub University in Awassa, and universities in Jimma, Mekele, and Bahir Dar. Literacy rates in Ethiopia are much lower than regional and world averages. About half the male population is literate; literacy rate estimates for the female population range from about one-third to two-fifths.   Cultural life  Daily life and social customs St. George, from a 17th-century Ethiopian manuscript of the GospelsFull-page illustration of St. George, from a 17th-century Ethiopian manuscript of the four Gospels; in the British Library, London.(more)The cultural heritage of Ethiopians resides in their religions, languages, and extended families. All major language and religious groups have their own cultural practices (which also vary by geographic location); however, there are commonalities that form strong and recognizable national traits. Most Ethiopians place less importance on artifacts of culture than they do on an idealized ethos of cultural refinement as reflected in a respect for human sanctity, the practice of social graces, and the blessings of accumulated wisdom. Religion provides the basic tenets of morality. The invocation of God is often all that is needed to seal agreements, deliver on promises, and seek justifiable redress. Hospitality is reckoned the ultimate expression of grace in social relations. Old age earns respect and prominence in society, especially because of the piety, wisdom, knowledge, prudence, and altruism that it is supposed to bestow. The influence of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church on the national culture has been strong. Easter (Amharic: Yetinsa-e Be-al, or Fassika), Christmas (Yelidet Be-al, or Genna), and the Finding of the True Cross (Meskel) have become dominant national holidays. In an effort to reduce the dominance of Christianity, both the Derg and the EPRDF-led government have elevated the status of Islam. Major Islamic holidays include Eid al-Fitr (ending the fast of Ramadan) and Eid al-Adha (ending the period of pilgrimage to Mecca). Nondenominational holidays include National Day on May 28, in observance of the 1991 defeat of the Derg regime, and Workers Day on May 1. Ethiopias distinctive cuisine has gained a worldwide reputation. Its most typical dishes are wats and alechas, stews redolent with spices and aromatic vegetables. The wat is further enhanced by the addition of berbere, a complex seasoning paste made incendiary by dried hot chilies. The wat or alecha may contain beef, goat, lamb, chicken, hard-boiled eggs, or fish. Berbere and other spice pastes enliven many dishes. A spiced clarified butter, niter kebbeh, is widely used to flavour sauted foods. Since the Ethiopian Orthodox Church mandates abstaining from meat on as many as 250 days a year, vegetarian dishes form an important part of Ethiopian cuisine. Legumes such as lentils or chickpeas appear in many guises. Other popular dishes include kitfo, chopped raw beef served with berbere. A traditional Ethiopian meal is served on a communal platter covered with thin sheets of injera, a soft flat-bread prepared from a slightly fermented batter made from teff, a type of millet. The spongy injera serves as both plate and utensil; it is topped with meat and vegetable stews. Ayib, a fresh soft cheese similar to cottage cheese, serves to temper the heat of the spicy dishes. Each diner tears off a piece of injera and uses it to scoop up a morsel of one or more dishes and their sauces. One diner may feed an injera-wrapped morsel to another, a practice called gursha. Tej, a honey-based wine, or beer accompanies the meal, and coffee sweetened with honey concludes it. Tea is grown in Ethiopia and is also a popular beverage.   The arts Traditional Ethiopian music is as diverse as the countrys population. Many of the songs in the Amharic language incorporate a layered meaning that is described as gold and wax. Such songs can be interpreted as having both a spiritual theme (gold) and a meaning that is more personal and earthy (wax). The poet Mary Armede is an accomplished contemporary practitioner of this style. Influences of foreign music have been very selective, though brass ensembles and soul music have made an important impact. The celebrated Wallias and Roha bands are popular, as are singers Neway Debebe and Netsanet Mellesse. Ethiopian literature, which has a long tradition, is written primarily either in classical Geez or in Amharic. The earliest extant literary works in Geez are translations of Christian religious writings from Greek, which may have influenced their style and syntax. During the 16th century, Amharic, then the principal spoken language, began to be used for literary purposes. Geez poetry (qene) flourished in the 18th century and has since continued to be practiced at many monasteries. After Ethiopia regained its independence from Italy in 1941, authors were encouraged to write with an emphasis on moral and patriotic themes, and there was a focus on Amharic literature. Notable writers during this period include Makonnen Endalkachew, who produced allegorical novels and plays, Kebede Mikael, known for verse dramas, and Tekle Tsodeq Makuria, known for histories.

Evidence of Ethiopias rich cultural history is also found throughout the country at various sites, several of which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage sites. The lower valleys of both the Awash and Omo rivers are home to several paleoanthropological sites that have yielded remains that provide evidence for the theory of human evolution. One of the best-known fossil remains is a partially complete female skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis, popularly known as Lucy, which was discovered at the Hadar site in the lower Awash River valley. Tiya, south of Addis Ababa, is an archaeological site that contains more than 30 monuments from an ancient Ethiopian culture. The city of Aksum, once the seat of an ancient kingdom of the same name, is home to obelisks, castle ruins, and tombs, some of which date back to the 1st century ce. Ethiopias long Christian tradition is evident in several rock-hewn churches, dating back to the 13th century, situated in the landscape of Lalibela. The historical town of Harar Jungol in southern Ethiopia developed into an important centre of Islamic culture and trade by the 16th century; its architecture and layout are notable for their unique blend of African and Islamic influences. The fortress city of Fasil Ghebbi in Gonder includes the remains of castles and palaces constructed by a series of emperors during the 17th and 18th centuries.  "},{"CountryName":"Finland","CulturalInfo":"Cultural lifeCultural milieuFinland is one of the most ethnically and culturally homogeneous countries in Europe. Nevertheless, Finns have been quick to incorporate ideas and impulses from Russia, elsewhere in Scandinavia, and continental Europe, particularly in the arts, music, architecture, and the sciences, but in each instance these influences have evolved into a form that is typically Finnish.Despite their strong neighbours to the east and west, Finns have preserved and developed the Finnish language, while adapting it to new terminology as needed; for example, the word tietokone (knowledge machine) was coined as the Finnish word for computer instead of adopting a variant from another language.Finns also have kept their cultural identity intact despite the powerful outside influences of neighbouring Finnic, Baltic, and Germanic peoples. Indeed, the traditional region of Karelia (now divided between Finland and Russia), where the songs of the Finnish national epic Kalevala originated, bears little influence from either Swedish or Russian culture.The best-known Finnish regional groups are the Savolainen, Karjalainen, Hmlinen, and Pohjalainen (from the Savo, Karelia, Hame, and Ostrobothnia regions, respectively). These groups are often characterized with standard descriptors; for example, the Karjalainen are frequently referred to as talkative. Other regional stereotypes exist for those from Kainuu, Finland proper, and the Satakunta region, but these characterizations are not nearly as common in popular media as are those for the first four groups.Daily life and social customsMany Finnish customs are closely associated with forests, which Finns have historically seen not as dark foreboding places but rather as offering refuge and shelter. In one of Finlands signature literary works, Seven Brothers, 19th-century writer Aleksis Kivi depicts the socially inept brothers flight to the protection of the woods. Today, on weekends and during holidays, Finns flee from urban stress to their forest summerhouses.Other customs associated with trees and wood are alive and well in Finland. Bonfires are lit at Midsummer, the doorways of houses are decorated with birches, and leafy birch whisks are still used in the traditional wooden sauna. On Easter, mmmi, a pudding made from malt and rye flour, is traditionally eaten from containers made of (or made to resemble) birch bark. In late winter, while snow covers the ground, birch branches are brought indoors to remind the household of the coming spring.Although Finns consider Santa Claus to have his permanent home in Korvatunturi, in northern Finland, the spruce Christmas tree is a relative newcomer to the country, having made its first appearance in the 1820s. Now the Christmas tree is a fixture of Finnish Christmas celebrations, which also involve special foods, including rice porridge (made with milk and cinnamon), a baked glazed ham, and a potato and carrot or rutabaga gratin. The holiday is not complete without a Christmas sauna bath.New Years Eve is celebrated with private and public fireworks displays. Large crowds also gather in Helsinkis Senate Square to hear speeches and music. Perhaps the most-interesting Finnish New Years Eve tradition is the melting of tin: small bits of tin (or lead), usually shaped like horseshoes, are melted and then thrown into cold water, with the resulting shape or its shadow interpreted as a symbolic harbinger of the future.Another of the most important holidays in Scandinavia, Midsummerwhich celebrates the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solsticeis known in Finland as Juhannus (a name that is derived from the feast of St. John the Baptist). The solstice falls on June 20 or 21 and is officially celebrated in Finland on the Saturday that falls between June 20th and 26th, with the three-day weekend national holiday beginning on Friday, Midsummers Eve. Typically, the celebration involves music, dance, and the lighting of bonfires, as well as trips to the country for city dwellers. Vappu, which effectively combines the celebration of Walpurgis Night and May Day, is yet another important holiday in Finland. The celebration of that holiday, which dates to at least the 18th century, begins on the evening of April 30, usually with merrymaking related to the drinking of alcoholic beverages, and continues the following day, including more family-related activities.Wood is an essential component of the typical Finnish sauna, which is almost universally constructed out of birch or other sturdy wood beams. Bathers sit on wooden benches, splashing water on the hot stones of the stove and whisking each other with birch branches, just as their ancestors would have done millennia earlier. Traditionally, the sauna was a sacred place for the Finns, used not only for the weekly sauna bath but also for ritual purposes. This was particularly the case for those rituals performed by women, such as healing the sick and preparing the dead for burial. The sauna was also used for doing laundry and for key farming activities, such as curing meat and fermenting and drying malt. Given its importance to the farm economy, it is logical that the sauna was originally built within the enclosure surrounding the farms outbuildings. The current placement of most saunas on a lakeside or coastal inlet goes back only to the early 20th century, following the fashion of the gentrys villas.saunaWooden sauna, Finland.(more)For a long time the sauna (whose name comes from a Finnish-Sami word) was usually heated only once a week, because it took a whole day to prepare it to stand several rounds of bathers (with men and women bathing separately). Many Finns believe sauna baths provide healing for the mind and body, and they are taken with almost religious reverence. Although not playing the central role it does in Finnish culture, the custom of sauna bathing is also widespread among the other Finnic peoples in the Baltic regionthe Estonians, Karelians, Veps, and Livoniansas well as among Latvians and Lithuanians."},{"CountryName":"France","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life For much of its history, France has played a central role in European culture. With the advent of colonialism and global trade, France reached a worldwide market, and French artistic, culinary, and sartorial styles influenced the high and popular cultures of nations around the globe. Today French customs, styles, and theories remain an influential export, as well as a point of great national pride, even as French intellectuals worry that the rise of globalism has prompted, in the words of the historian Pierre Nora, the rapid disappearance of our national memory. Cultural milieu French culture is derived from an ancient civilization composed of a complex mix of Celtic, Greco-Roman, and Germanic elements. Monuments, especially from the period of Roman occupation, are numerous and include the amphitheatre at Arles, the arnes (arenas) in Paris, and the aqueduct at Pont du Gard. During the Middle Ages a rich culture developed, fostered in particular by monks and scholars in monasteries and universities and encouraged well into the 18th century by a system of royal and aristocratic patronage. Important trade fairs in growing cities such as Paris, Nancy, Strasbourg, and Lyon enabled the spread of artistic ideas and cultural trends to and from other regions, placing France at the centre of a nascent European high culture that would reach its greatest expression in the Renaissance. From the early 1700s and with the development of a middle class, the bourgeoisie, culture became more generally accessible. This was the age of the Enlightenment, of inquiry and question. Cultural activity remained largely centred in Paris, but smaller cities such as Aix-les-Bains, Grenoble, and Lyon were vital in their own right. The culture of the Enlightenment was built on reason and analytic argumentation, mirrored, as political scientist Alexis de Tocqueville remarked, in the French Revolutions attraction for general theories, for general systems of legislation, the exact symmetry of lawsthe same desire to remake the entire constitution at once following the rules of logic and in accordance with a single plan, instead of seeking ways to amend its parts. Among its tenets was the idea of meritocracy, or an aristocracy of ability and intelligence, which accorded a central place to intellectuals unknown in most other societies and opened Frances schools to students from the provinces without regard for social class. With free primary education compulsory by the late 19th century, basic literacy ensured that the general cultural level was raised. This was further aided by the increase in the number of newspapers and, later, by the development of radio, cinema, television, and the Internet. After World War II the intellectual and social development of lower-income groups benefited from the decision to make free secondary education compulsory up to age 16. Cultural literacy expanded as newspaper circulations rose, lending libraries proliferated, and in 1954 a revolution began in paperback books (livre de poche). This last development met with enormous success, providing people of all ages and classes with much greater access to literature and other forms of specialized knowledge. The Ministry of Culture and Communications oversees the major cultural institutions of the nation. The department, first led by novelist Andr Malraux, seeks to redouble arts awareness among ordinary people, support the creation of new art, and protect existing French forms and properties as wide-ranging as monuments and language. The cultural map of France remains firmly centred on Paris, despite increased expenditure by local authorities on cultural activities following the decentralization legislation of the early 1980s. Yet, while serving, often self-consciously, the interests of the whole nation, the capital is aware of its own internal differences. Most of the citys arrondissements (municipal districts) have groups actively researching their history and traditions, and local art exhibitions and concerts are encouraged. In the rest of the country, provincial culture is strong and often fiercely defendedfor example, in Brittany, parts of the south, and Alsace. French culture has felt the impact made by immigrants, especially those from North Africa beginning in the 1960s. The Muslim communities that have formed, notably in Paris and Marseille, have not escaped discrimination, but there is a widespread acknowledgment of their contributions to cuisine, music, dance, painting, and literature. Verlan, a slang of standard French that reverses and reshuffles French syllables and spellings, traces its roots to the 19th century but was revived by postwar immigrant communities and in recent decades has made inroads into mainstream society. Beginning in the 1980s, second- and third-generation North Africans were often referred to as les beurs, and beur cinema, beur comics, and beur radio, among other forms of expression, have found a large audience. The label beur is itself a Verlan term for arabe, the French word for Arab. In addition, Asian and sub-Saharan African immigrants have attained prominence as artists, writers, and musicians in Frances increasingly multicultural society. "},{"CountryName":"Gabon","CulturalInfo":" Government and society  Constitutional framework Under the constitution of February 1961, which was in force for three decades, the Gabonese republic had an executive branch more powerful than the legislative and judicial branches. During the 1970s the constitution was amended to give the Gabonese Democratic Party (Parti Dmocratique Gabonais; PDG), the only legal party after 1968, roles in the executive and legislative processes. In May 1990, following a national conference that was called in response to the upheaval of the previous four months, the constitution was amended to end the institutional role of the PDG and to restore a multiparty system. Parliamentary elections were held in SeptemberOctober 1990, after which a new National Assembly adopted the constitution of March 1991; the constitution has since been amended. Under the constitution the president, who is head of state, serves a seven-year term. The National Assembly has legislative powers, but the president has the authority to dissolve the National Assembly and postpone legislation. The president nominates the prime minister, who as head of the government selects the members of the Council of Ministers in consultation with the president. The president also has the power to remove the prime minister and council members from office. In practice most of the ministers are drawn from the 120 deputies in the National Assembly, which confirms the Council of Ministers and may oust the government through a vote of no confidence after a certain period. The constitution provided for an upper legislative house (Senate) for the first time in the history of the republic, and the first elections to the Senate (indirect by local councils) were held in early 1997. A constitutional amendment passed by a PDG-dominated Assembly in April 1997 designated that the president of the Senate would succeed the president of the republic in case of the latters death or incapacity. The position of vice president of the republic was also created by amendment; the vice president, who cannot succeed the president, is appointed by and assists the president. The 1991 constitution also provides strong guarantees for both individual and public liberties not found in the document of 1961. A Charter of Parties adopted at the same time as the constitution defines the role of Gabons political parties in a multiparty democracy.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tBritannica Quiz\t\tGeography of Africa Quiz \t\n   Local government and justice Administratively, Gabon is divided into nine provinces, which are further divided into prfectures and sous-prfectures (subprefectures). Provincial governors, prefects, and subprefects are all appointed by the president. The highest courts in Gabons judiciary system are the countrys former Supreme Court chambers: a judicial court, an administrative court, and a court of accounts, each with absolute authority over its area of expertise. Courts of appeal are found in Franceville and Libreville, and smaller tribunal courts exist throughout the country. There is also a constitutional court, which is the highest court with regards to constitutional matters. The judicial system includes customary law courts, presided over by traditional chiefs who mediate local disputes.   Health and welfare Health facilities remain inadequate, particularly outside the Libreville area, despite improvements since the 1970s. The government provides nearly all health care services. The internationally known hospital operated by Albert Schweitzer from 1924 to 1965 and now named after him is located in Lambarn. Malaria, sleeping sickness, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases are widespread problems. HIV/AIDS is also a growing problem in Gabon, as the prevalence rate has increased since the early 1990s.   Education Gabons educational system continues to be modeled closely on that of France. French remains the sole medium of instruction; Bantu languages are studied as electives at the secondary and higher levels. Education is officially mandatory from ages 6 to 16. Primary education lasts for six years, and secondary education consists of a four-year cycle followed by a three-year cycle. Institutes of higher education include Omar Bongo University (1970) in Libreville, which has programs in most fields and some advanced studies; the University of Health Sciences (2002), also in Libreville; and the University of Science and Technology of Masuku (1986), located near Franceville. Many Gabonese study abroad, particularly in France, at the university and graduate levels. Almost three-fourths of the adult population is literate, which is similar to the regional average and slightly lower than the world average.

Gabons contemporary writers express themselves almost exclusively in French. At the same time, there has been continued interest in Gabons precolonial history and traditions, and much research continues on the Fang epic (mvet) and the art of the Mpongwe, Fang, and Kota. In 1983 the International Centre for Bantu Civilizations was created, with its headquarters at Libreville. The National Museum of Arts and Traditions is also in Libreville.  Sports and recreation Football (soccer) is the national sport in Gabon, though much of the play is limited to the coast because of the dense rainforest in the interior. Gabon founded a football federation in 1962, and it became affiliated with the International Federation of Association Football the following year. Basketball is also popular in Gabon, and the country is a member of the International Basketball Federation. A number of Gabonese participate in boxing, and squash is developing a following, especially in Libreville. The countrys scenic landscape also attracts hikers and cyclists. In 1965 Gabon formed an Olympic committee, which was recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1968. Gabonese athletes first competed in the Olympics at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich. The countrys first Olympic medal was earned at the 2012 Summer Games in London by Anthony Obame, who won the silver medal in the tae kwon do competition.   Media and publishing Several newspapers and other periodicals are published in French. The government-owned LUnion is published daily, while most private publications are published weekly or less frequently. National radio stations broadcast in French as well as in local languages. Gabon is also the site of an international radio network, Africa No. 1, that reaches much of the continent. There are both state-owned and private television stations in the country. French publications circulate extensively, and television programs are relayed from France. Brian Weinstein David E.

They have through the ages been noted as warriors as well as for their hospitality, love of life, lively intelligence, sense of humour, and reputed longevity (although statistical data does not support this latter assertion). Georgia has a literary tradition that dates to the 5th century ce. Kolkhida (Colchis) early housed a school of higher rhetoric in which Greeks as well as Georgians studied. By the 12th century, academies in Ikalto and Gelati, the first medieval higher-education centres, disseminated a wide range of knowledge. The national genius was demonstrated most clearly in Vepkhis-tqarsani (The Knight in the Panthers Skin), the epic masterpiece of the 12th-century poet Shota Rustaveli. Major figures in later Georgian literary history include a famed 18th-century writer, Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani, and the novelist, poet, and dramatist Ilia Chavchavadze. The 19th-century playwright Giorgi Eristavi is regarded as the founder of the modern Georgian theatre. Among other prominent prerevolutionary authors were the lyric poet Akaki Tsereteli; Alexander Qazbegi, novelist of the Caucasus; and the nature poet Vazha Pshavela. The novelist Mikhail Javakhishvili and the poet Titsian Tabidze were executed during the Stalin era, and the poet Paolo Iashvili was censured by the government and committed suicide. Giorgi Leonidze and Galaktion Tabidze were well-known poets, and Konstantin Gamsakhurdia was celebrated for his historical novels. The Abkhazian literary tradition dates back only to the late 19th century. Notable writers include the poet, novelist, and scholar Dmitri Gulia, the novelist and playwright Samson Chanba, the poet Bagrat Shinkuba, and Fazil Iskander, a popular satirist who writes in Russian. Important individuals in other arts include the painters Niko Pirosmani (Pirosmanashvili), Irakli Toidze, Lado Gudiashvili, Elena Akhvlediani, and Sergo Kobuladze; the composers Zakaria Paliashvili and Meliton Balanchivadze (father of the choreographer George Balanchine); and the founder of Georgian ballet, Vakhtang Chabukiani. Georgian theatre, in which outstanding directors of the Soviet period were Kote Mardzhanishvili, Sandro Akhmeteli, and Robert Sturm, has had a marked influence in Europe and elsewhere. The Georgian film Repentance, an allegory about the repressions of the Stalin era, was directed by Tenghiz Abuladze. It won the Special Jury Prize at the 1987 Cannes film festival and was widely praised for its political courage. The ancient culture of the republic is reflected in the large number of architectural monuments, including many monasteries and churches; indeed, Georgian architecture (with Armenian) played a considerable role in the development of the Byzantine style. Georgia has a long tradition of fine metalwork. Bronze, gold, and silver objects of a high technical and aesthetic standard have been recovered from tombs of the 1st and 2nd millennia bce. Between the 10th and 13th centuries ce, Georgian goldsmiths produced masterpieces of cloisonn enamel and repouss work, notably icons, crosses, and jewelry. A number of newspapers and periodicals are published, most of them in Georgian. Radio programs are broadcast in Georgian and in several minority languages, and television programs are broadcast in Georgian and Russian. Mikhail Leonidovich Djibladze G. Melvyn Howe  History Archaeological findings make it possible to trace the origins of human society on the territory of modern Georgia back to the early Paleolithic and Neolithic periods. A number of Neolithic sites have been excavated in the Kolkhida Lowland, in the Khrami River valley in central Georgia, and in South Ossetia; they were occupied by settled tribes engaged in cattle raising and agriculture. The cultivation of grain in Georgia during the Neolithic Period is attested by finds of saddle querns and flint sickles; the earth was tilled with stone mattocks. The Caucasus was regarded in ancient times as the primeval home of metallurgy. The start of the 3rd millennium bce witnessed the beginning of Georgias Bronze Age. Remarkable finds in Trialeti show that central Georgia was inhabited during the 2nd millennium bce by cattle-raising tribes whose chieftains were men of wealth and power. Their burial mounds have yielded finely wrought vessels in gold and silver; a few are engraved with ritual scenes suggesting Asiatic cult influence.  Origins of the Georgian nation Early in the 1st millennium bce, the ancestors of the Georgian nation emerge in the annals of Assyria and, later, of Urartu. Among these were the Diauhi (Diaeni) nation, ancestors of the Taokhoi, who later domiciled in the southwestern Georgian province of Tao, and the Kulkha, forerunners of the Colchians, who held sway over large territories at the eastern end of the Black Sea. The fabled wealth of Colchis became known quite early to the Greeks and found symbolic expression in the legend of Medea and the Golden Fleece. Following the influx of tribes driven from the direction of Anatolia by the Cimmerian invasion of the 7th century bce and their fusion with the aboriginal population of the Kura River valley, the centuries immediately preceding the Christian era witnessed the growth of the important kingdom of Iberia, the region that now comprises modern Kartli and Kakheti, along with Samtskhe and adjoining regions of southwestern Georgia. Colchis was colonized by Greek settlers from Miletus and subsequently fell under the sway of Mithradates VI Eupator, king of Pontus. The campaigns of the Roman general Pompey the Great led in 66 bce to the establishment of Roman hegemony over Iberia and to direct Roman rule over Colchis and the rest of Georgias Black Sea littoral.   Medieval Georgia Georgia embraced Christianity about the year 330; its conversion is attributed to a holy captive woman, St. Nino. During the next three centuries, Georgia was involved in the conflict between Romeand its successor state, the Byzantine Empireand the Persian Ssnian dynasty. Lazica on the Black Sea (incorporating the ancient Colchis) became closely bound to Byzantium. Iberia passed under Persian control, though toward the end of the 5th century a hero arose in the person of King Vakhtang Gorgaslani (Gorgasal), a ruler of legendary valour who for a time reasserted Georgias national sovereignty. The Ssnian monarch Khosrow I (reigned 531579) abolished the Iberian monarchy, however. For the next three centuries, local authority was exercised by the magnates of each province, vassals successively of Persia (Iran), of Byzantium, and, after 654 ce, of the Arab caliphs, who established an emirate in Tbilisi. (See Iran, ancient.) Toward the end of the 9th century, Ashot I (the Great), of the Bagratid dynasty, settled at Artanuji in Tao (southwestern Georgia), receiving from the Byzantine emperor the title of kuropalates (guardian of the palace). In due course, Ashot profited from the weakness of the Byzantine emperors and the Arab caliphs and set himself up as hereditary prince in Iberia. King Bagrat III (reigned 9751014) later united all the principalities of eastern and western Georgia into one state. Tbilisi, however, was not recovered from the Muslims until 1122, when it fell to King David IV (Aghmashenebeli, the Builder; reigned 10891125). The zenith of Georgias power and prestige was reached during the reign (11841213) of Queen Tamar, whose realm stretched from Azerbaijan to the borders of Cherkessia (now in southern Russia) and from Erzurum (in modern Turkey) to Ganja (modern Gnc, Azerbaijan), forming a pan-Caucasian empire, with Shirvan and Trabzon as vassals and allies. The invasions of Transcaucasia by the Mongols from 1220 onward, however, brought Georgias golden age to an end. Eastern Georgia was reduced to vassalage under the Mongol Il-Khanid dynasty of the line of Hleg, while Imereti, as the land to the west of the Suram range was called, remained independent under a separate line of Bagratid rulers. There was a partial resurgence during the reign (131446) of King Giorgi V of Georgia, known as the Brilliant, but the onslaughts of the Turkic conqueror Timur between 1386 and 1403 dealt blows to Georgias economic and cultural life from which the kingdom never recovered. The last king of united Georgia was Alexander I (141243), under whose sons the realm was divided into squabbling princedoms.

Indeed, the historian Hagen Schulze observed that  the German nation was born in the minds of the intelligentsia, as a cultural entity without direct ties to politics. It was therefore only logical that its great heroes were not princes and military leaders as in France and England but rather a collection of poets and philosophers.Germanys extraordinary cultural flowering made it the new Greece, said both Friedrich von Schiller and Wilhelm von Humboldtpowerless but intellectually supreme.  That ideal fell only when the German nation began to experiment with power and expand militarily, but it remains fondly held by contemporary German intellectuals as a model worthy of emulation in a new Europe. The WartburgThe Wartburg, on a hill above Eisenach, Germany.(more)During the period of partition, West Germany, as heir to Germanys older regions, was custodian of the greater portion of the countrys rich cultural legacy. The majority of Germanys architectural monumentsof Roman Germany and of the medieval Romanesque and southern German Baroque stylesfell within its borders, as did many of the great libraries, archives, and facilities for the performing arts. Yet some of the greatest monuments of German cultural and historical achievement were located in East Germany, including the Wartburg of Martin Luther, the Weimar of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and the Leipzig of Johann Sebastian Bach; a large share of prewar Germanys art treasures also rested in East Germany, especially in East Berlin and Dresden. After the division of Germany, many of the cultural assets originally from the eastern sector were removed to the West or to Russia, which generally refused to return them after unification. For example, it is estimated that some 200,000 works of art were taken from Germany after World War II, and German sources estimate that more than 4.6 million books were taken; Russian holdings include a Gutenberg bible and thousands of works from the Berlin Museums East Asian collection. Nonetheless, some materials, such as a stained-glass window from the Marienkirche in Frankfurt, have been returned. Many of East Germanys artists, writers, and institutions, including entire publishing houses, relocated to West Germany or set up successor organizations there. Food history: How to make German Black Forest cakeLearn more about the history of the German Black Forest cake.(more)See all videos for this articleDespite the political division, the German cultural and artistic tradition remained identifiably the same. In the German-speaking world, a writer or painter or composer or playwright or sculptor was German whether holding a passport from the Federal Republic or from the Democratic Republic. Moreover, in art and literature the adjective deutsch (German) has no strict political boundaries. For example, the Austrian composer Gustav Mahler, the Czech novelist Franz Kafka, the Romanian poet Paul Celan, and the Swiss playwright Friedrich Drrenmatt all are considered German because their work falls within the German cultural tradition. During the four decades of separation it was inevitable that some divergence would occur in the cultural life of the two Germanys. Both followed traditional paths of the common German culture, but West Germany, obviously more susceptible to influences from western Europe and North America, became more cosmopolitan. Conversely, East Germany, while remaining surprisingly conservative in its adherence to some aspects of tradition, was powerfully molded by the dictates of a socialist ideology of predominantly Soviet inspiration. The state, as virtually the sole market for artistic products, inevitably had the last word. Goethes garden houseGoethes garden house, Weimar, Germany; detail of a photomechanical print, c. 18901900.

The Goethe House and Goethe National Museum on the Frauenplanstrasse in Weimar were carefully restored after the war and meticulously maintained; the Thomanerchor at the St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, the boys choir made famous by Bach, continued to perform the cantatas and motets of the master in exactly the style of two and a half centuries previously; Dresden, though devastated by wartime bombing, made it an early priority to restore its opera house; and the music ensembles of East Germany, especially the Dresden Philharmonic and the Dresdner Staatskapelle, together with the Gewandhaus and Rundfunk orchestras of Leipzig, remained part of the mainstream of European music, touring in the West and freely exchanging performers, conductors, and producers. It has been remarked that during their separation the two Germanys diverged not at all in music and only slightly in literature and the theatre but sharply in architecture and the plastic arts.

This is followed by three years of senior secondary education, which consists of vocational programs or courses that prepare students for university studies or other third-cycle coursework in high-level polytechnics and specialized institutions. Basic education is free and compulsory. Senior secondary education was made free in 2017. University education is provided at institutions such as the University of Ghana, with campuses at Legon and Accra (established 1948), the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology at Kumasi (1951), the University of Cape Coast (1962), the University of Education at Winneba (1992), and the University for Development Studies at Tamale (1992). In addition, there are many technical and training colleges in the country, and Accra is home to the National Film and Television Institute (1978). Enrollment in all schools, especially in secondary schools, soared dramatically after Ghana achieved self-government. In addition to government-funded schools, there are a number of private schools at both elementary and secondary levels. About three-fourths of the adult population is literate. Ghanas literacy rate, although much higher that the average for West and Central Africa, is lower than the world average.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu AkuabaAkan Akuaba figure, a fertility doll cared for by women who desire successful pregnancies.(more)Ghana has a rich indigenous culture. Culturally, the peoples of Ghana have many affinities with their French-speaking neighbours, but each ethnic group has distinctive cultural attributes. In all parts of the country the cultural heritage is closely linked with religion and the institution of chieftaincy. Various festivals and rites are centred on chieftaincy and the family and are occasioned by such events as harvest, marriage, birth, puberty, and death. Ghanaian society is without sharp class distinctions. Insofar as traditional authority is based on a system of hereditary chieftaincy, it is possible to speak of aristocratic classes within the ethnic groups, but the institution of chieftaincy is essentially democratic in operation, and the authority of chiefs is broadly based. Land is usually owned by families, militating against the emergence of a small, powerful landed class wielding economic control over a landless class. These inherent egalitarian tendencies of the society have been heightened by economic and social mobility, depending on education and individual enterprise.  "},{"CountryName":"Greece","CulturalInfo":" Local government Reorganized administratively in 2011 according to the so-called Kallikratis Plan, Greece is divided into seven apokentromnes dioikseis (decentralized administrations), the head of each of which is appointed by the central government. These units are further divided into 13 perifreies (regions), which mirror the 13 geographic diamerismata (regions) that existed under the previous administrative structure. At the next level of local government are the 74 perifereiaks entites (regional units), the administrative and territorial constituents of parts of the regions. Finally, the most local of these administrative unis are the 325 dmoi (municipalities).   Justice The judiciary is essentially the Roman law system prevalent in continental Europe. The two highest courts are the Supreme Court (Areios Pagos), which deals with civil and criminal cases, and the Council of State (Symvoulion Epikrateias), which is responsible for administration disputes. A Court of State Auditors has jurisdiction in a number of financial matters. A Special Supreme Tribunal deals with disputes over the interpretation of the constitution and checks the validity of parliamentary elections and referenda.   Political process Many elements of traditional politics remain in Greece, most notably the personality-based nature of the party system. Parties are heavily dependent on the charisma of their leaders, and patronage is important at all levels. In the early 21st century the major political parties included New Democracy (Nea Dimokratia; ND), the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Panellinio Sosialistiko Kinima; PASOK), Syriza (Coalition of the Radical Left), and the Communist Party of Greece (Kommunistiko Komma Elladas; KKE). New Democracy, founded by the veteran conservative politician Konstantinos Karamanlis, consistently supported neoliberal policies that aimed at limiting the power of the state and encouraging private initiatives and market economics. The PASOK retained a strong commitment to an independent foreign policy and a modified form of socialism. On the far left was the KKE, which continued to advocate Soviet-style communism.   Security The military, made up of an army, a navy, and an air force, was a major arbiter of political life during the 20th century. Greeces expenditure on defense is one of the highest in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) but is largely motivated by its preoccupation with Turkey, the countrys traditional enemy. Conscription for men is universal, and women have the right to volunteer for service.   Health and welfare In the 1980s the government instituted a national health care system. Many Greek doctors train, at least partly, abroad, and they and the major hospitals meet international standards; however, Greeks often choose to travel abroad for medical care if they can afford it. The pension system in Greece is extraordinarily complex. Workers are insured under the Social Insurance Institute and the Agricultural Insurance Organization programs.   Housing New housing construction accelerated at the end of the 20th century, particularly in the larger cities. Urban areas are characterized by apartment buildings. In fact, about half of all housing units in the early 21st century were apartments. Discrimination in housing in Greece was noted by international observers, who cited poor access to adequate housing and forced eviction among the Roma (Gypsies).   Education Education has long been prized in Greece, both as an end in itself and as a means of upward social mobility. Wealthy Greeks of the diaspora have been major benefactors of schools and universities in their homeland. The state educational system is somewhat rigid, heavily centralized, and generally considered inadequate. As a consequence, many children attend private phrontistiria, institutions that tutor students outside normal school hours. Education is free at all levels and is compulsory for children between ages 6 and 15. Nearly the entire population is literate. The oldest institutions of higher learning are the National Technical University of Athens (1836), the National and Capodistrian University of Athens (1837), and the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (1925). The latter institution has a tradition of innovation compared with the more conservative University of Athens. There are several other universities and polytechnical schools and a school of fine arts; however, those institutions are often inadequately equipped and lack a sufficient number of admission openings to satisfy the demand for higher education. Many Greek students therefore choose to study abroad.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu The important sites of Greek antiquity that first attracted aristocratic and upper-class Europeans to the Greek lands in the 18th century and which influenced architectural styles in the West continue to attract tourists from throughout the world. Excavated sites such as the supposed tomb of Philip II of Macedon at Verghina, the Pompeii-like remains at Akrotri on the island of Thra, and the Minoan palace at Zkros on Crete are a few examples of a remarkably rich heritage from antiquity that has still not been fully explored. Since the beginning of the 20th century, awareness has grown of the architectural and artistic influence of the Byzantine Empire on historic Greek churches, frescoes, mosaics, and icons. Recognized too is not only a minor renaissance of Greek art and culture during the many centuries under Venetian and western European rule (c. 12041669) but also the contributions of Greeks to the greater Renaissance of Italy. The Renaissance in Greeceand in Crete in particularproduced handsome buildings, frescoes, and icons as well as poetry and drama; examples of these include the Venetian Loggia in Irklion, the paintings of Michael Damaskinos (Michail Damaskenos; flourished late 16th century), the romantic-epic poem Erotocritos by Vitsntzos Kornros, and the pageant-wagon drama Abraham and Isaac. In addition, Greek scholars, translators, and printers of the period introduced the classics to western Europe. Less known to foreigners but highly valued by Greeks today is the culture that emerged in the 19th century, both popular and high, as Greeks struggled to establish their new nation-state and language. They took pride in their traditional lore and poems, especially their brigand songs, which celebrated defiance of their oppressors, while such writers as Yannis Psichris, Andras Ioanndis Kalvos, Dhionsios Soloms, and Alexandros Papadiamndis helped to forge a new Greek identityone that now took pride in prevailing across centuries against foreign occupiers, in preserving the demotic language and popular customs, and in reasserting Greeces place in the history of Western civilization. Greeks celebrate their winning of independence from the Ottoman Empire with a national holiday on March 25.

Several shipping lines maintain regular passenger and cargo services to North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, and neighbouring West Indian islands.\nGovernment and society\nConstitutional framework\nGrenada is governed as a constitutional monarchy, with the British monarch represented by a governor-general as the nominal head of state. Executive authority is vested in a prime minister, who is the head of the majority party in the elected House of Representatives, the lower house of the two-chamber legislature. The Senate is appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister and the opposition leader.\nHealth and welfare\nGrenada has several main health centres, as well as district medical stations. Medical and dental treatment in government hospitals and clinics is free. The government has launched a program to eradicate malaria and mongoose-spread rabies.\nEducation\nSchool attendance is not compulsory, although primary and secondary education is free. Grenada has vocational and technical schools as well as the St. Georges University School of Medicine and a branch of the University of the West Indies.\nCultural life\nThe Grenada National Museum in St. Georges is dedicated to archaeology and history and houses the Grenada Historical Society. Two Grenadian artists, Elinus Cato and Canute Caliste, have achieved international recognition for their primitive-style paintings. Several weekly newspapers are published, and islandwide radio and television broadcasting is available.\nHistory\nGrenada was sighted by Christopher Columbus on August 15, 1498, when he sailed past the island without landing and gave it the name Concepcin. The origin of the name Grenada remains obscure. After Europeans first encountered it, Grenada was dominated for 150 years by the warlike Carib people, who had earlier killed off the more peaceful Arawak. In 1609 British merchants attempted to form a settlement, but the Caribs forced them to leave.\nFrench settlement\nThe French governor of Martinique, Jacques-Dyel du Parquet, purchased Grenada from a French company in 1650 and established a settlement at St. Georges. Grenada remained French until 1762, when it capitulated to the British. It was formally ceded to Britain in 1763 by the Treaty of Paris. In 1779 it was recaptured by the French, but it was restored to Britain in 1783.\nBritish rule\nIn the late 18th century the British imported large numbers of slaves from Africa to work the sugar plantations. During 1795 and 1796, when French policy favoured the abolition of slavery, a rebellion against British rule occurred, led by a French planter and supported by the French in Martinique. The rebels massacred a number of the British, including the lieutenant governor, but the uprising was quelled. The emancipation of the slaves finally took effect in 1833.\nGrenada was headquarters of the British Windward Islands government from 1885 until 1958, when Grenada joined the West Indies Federation. The federation ended in 1962, after which Grenada attempted to federate with the remaining territories in the Windward Islands, as well as with Barbados and the Leeward Islands. On March 3, 1967, however, the island became a self-governing state in association with the United Kingdom.\n"},{"CountryName":"Guatemala","CulturalInfo":" Political process All citizens over age 18 are obliged to register to vote and to participate in elections, however compulsory voting is not enforced and there are no sanctions in Guatemala. Broad guarantees are provided for the organization and functioning of political parties, except for the Communist Party and any other that is deemed to be dedicated to the overthrow of the democratic process. Only authorized political parties may nominate candidates for president, vice president, and Congress. Candidates for mayor and other municipal offices need not be nominated by political parties. Following the Peace Accords of 1996, various guerrilla groups agreed to lay down their arms and enter the political process. Women also began to increasingly participate in government-sponsored programs. Organized womens groups began to emerge, and the recognition of women as a driving political force in Guatemalan society owed much to the support of international organizations. Womens roles in documenting the disappearance and killing of citizens during and after the civil war tended to strengthen their collective voice. Moreover, women who had spent time in refugee camps during Guatemalas violent periods often returned home with a greater sense of empowerment and self-esteem; many became literate and had the opportunity to share their skills and experiences with other Guatemalan women who had not been in exile. Finally, another likely influence on the emergence of women as a political force was the prominence of Indigenous-rights activist and Nobel Prize winner Rigoberta Mench. There is a constant flux in the formation and demise of political parties. Those displaying the most continuity are the Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario; PR), which has shifted from left to right in political orientation, the centrist Guatemalan Christian Democratic Party (Partido Democracia Cristiana Guatemalteca; PDCG), and the right-wing National Liberation Movement (Movimiento de Liberacin Nacional; MLN). In the slightly more open political atmosphere of the 1990s, several new parties emerged as contenders: the National Centre Union (Unin Central Nacional; UCN), the Solidarity Action Movement (Movimiento de Accin Solidaria; MAS), the neoliberal National Advancement Party (Partido de Avanzada Nacional; PAN), and the National Alliance (Alianza National; AN). Notable parties that formed in the early 21st century include the National Unity ofr Hope (Unin Nacional de Esperanza; UNE), the Patriotic Party (Partido Patriota; PP), the Grand National Alliance (Gran Alianza Nacional; GANA), and the Centre of Social Action (Centro de Accin Social; CASA), which represents the interests of Indigenous people. Generally, Guatemalan voters still appear to have little faith in government because of its poor record in improving security and its inability to stop violent crime.   Security Guatemala has an army, navy (including marines), and air force. Male citizens between ages 18 and 50 are liable for conscription, with the military service obligation varying from 12 to 24 months. Although constitutionally outside of politics, the army nevertheless represents a powerful element in political struggles and has often controlled the government.   Health and welfare The inadequacy of Guatemalan medical and health services, particularly in rural areas, is reflected in the high rates of intestinal diseases and infant mortality. Inadequate sanitation and malnutrition are contributory factors. In larger communities the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance maintains hospitals that provide free care, and there are also numerous private hospitals. During the 1980s, rural health centres staffed by personnel trained in preventive medicine were established in hundreds of localities in an effort to improve the health of rural inhabitants. Though these centres have shown slow but continued improvement in the quality of care, the majority of rural dwellers still lack access to medical services, and about half of them have an inadequate diet. Since 1946 the Guatemalan Social Security Institute has provided medical insurance for public and private employees. The benefits cover accidents and common illness, as well as maternity care. The institute also maintains several hospitals.   Housing Rural settlements tend to radiate around the cabeceras (county seats) of the hundreds of municipios (municipalities) into which the country is divided. The living conditions in the vast majority of these settlements contrast sharply with the modern amenities of Guatemala City. Running water and up-to-date sanitary facilities are lacking in most homes. Dwellings tend to be made of adobe, cane, or planks and be roofed with thatch, tiles, shakes, or corrugated metal. Homes commonly have earthen floors.   Education In theory, education is free, secular, and compulsory through the primary school. Secondary schools train teachers, agricultural experts, industrial technicians, and candidates for universities. An enrollment of about two-thirds of those eligible to attend primary schools declines to less than one-fifth for secondary schools. The adult literacy rate (slightly less than three-fourths) is one of the lowest in Central America. In rural areas, even many of those who have attended primary schools (usually only to the third grade) are functionally illiterate as adults. Impoverishment and a low premium paid upon education contribute to these low literacy levels. Guatemalas universities are concentrated in the capital. The largest is the national University of San Carlos, founded in 1676. Other universities of Guatemala include Del Valle (1966), Francisco Marroqun (1971), Galileo (2000), Mariano Glvez (1966), and Rafael Landvar (1961). There are also specialized schools in art and music.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Guatemalan society is marked by pronounced extremes in the conduct of daily life. In Guatemala City, elite families live much as they do in the cosmopolitan centres of developed countries, communicating by e-mail, cell phones, and beepers. On the other hand, within an hours drive of the capital are Indigenous people whose patterns of daily life reflect those of past centuries and whose communities continue to be knit together by market life. Sharp contrasts like these pervade Guatemalan culture, whether it be in the language spoken or in matters pertaining to the household, cuisine, attire, or family affairs.  "},{"CountryName":"Guinea-Bissau","CulturalInfo":" Security of Guinea-BissauThe countrys military capability consists of an army, a navy, an air force, and a paramilitary force, of which the army and the paramilitary are the most substantial. Military service is determined by selective conscription, and individuals are eligible for service from 18 years of age.   Health and welfare The health care delivery system during the colonial period was grossly inadequate. Health care facilities were concentrated in the cities and towns, and the average expenditure per person was extremely low. Most never saw a doctor or dentist. Health care services have improved since independence, but the situation is still very poor. Infant mortality rates remain high, in large part because of diarrhea, malnutrition, and upper respiratory infections. Improper sanitation and waste treatment remain significant public health challenges, and much of the population remains undernourished. Tropical diseases, especially malaria, are widespread and entail high rates of mortality. Other health concerns include cholera, schistosomiasis, filariasis, and leprosy; mortalities resulting from automobile accidents, HIV/AIDS, and substance abuse are increasing. Under favourable circumstances, clinics and dressing stations (first-aid centres) operate at the local level with the small hospitals that operate in the larger towns. The main hospital in Bissau routinely faces critical shortages of necessities such as drugs, bandages, anesthetics, antibiotics, and plasma. Family planning, maternal and infant health care, power and water supply, and refrigeration are all rudimentary. Although the number of hospital beds has greatly increased since independence, availability is still vastly short of need. Furthermore, since the number of nurses has not kept pace with the increase in hospital beds, nursing service has actually declined.   Education Officially, six years of primary education is compulsory for children age 7 to 14. For those children who show scholastic promise, there are five years of secondary education. Amlcar Cabral University and the University of Colinas de Boe, both founded in 2003 and based in Bissau, provide opportunities for higher education. There are also schools for teacher training, nursing, and vocational training.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tBritannica Quiz\t\tWhich Country Is Larger By Area? Quiz\t\n Education during the colonial period was very poor. In the 1970s only a minute proportion of the population was enrolled in primary school, and illiteracy was almost universal. During the war of national liberation (196374), the PAIGC attempted to address this severe problem by establishing its own school system in the liberated zones and in external bases. Nevertheless, education in the context of the war was predictably difficult, and enrollment was inconsistent. Guinea-Bissaus educational system continues to face serious challenges. Only some two-fifths of school-age children attend school, and adult illiteracy remains high, particularly among women. The civil warfare of 199899 greatly disturbed a number of services, the educational system among them; progress in its reestablishment has been slow. There is also a shortage of teaching staff in rural areas in particular, where teachers themselves are frequently not well educated and where the ratio of students to teachers is very high. Ren Plissier Rosemary Elizabeth Galli Richard Andrew Lobban The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Five centuries of the civilizing mission of Portuguese colonialism did not penetrate deeply in Guinea-Bissau, and African culture and traditions are very much in place. These include the intact African languages with their associated folklore, sayings, dances, and music. Cape Verdean musicsuch as funana, a fast-paced genre that features the gaita, an accordion-like instrument, and finaon, performed by female vocalistshas become increasingly popular in cities and towns.   Daily life and social customs Christian holidays, including Christmas, and Muslim holidays, including Tabaski (also known as Eid al-Adha, marking the culmination of the hajj rites near Mecca) and Korit (also known as Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan), are observed in Guinea-Bissau. In addition to these, the death of Amlcar Cabral is observed on January 20, Labour Day on May 1, and the Anniversary of the Movement of Readjustment on November 14.   The arts The government organizes formal expressions of national culture through the national arts institute, which maintains a school of music and dance and conducts periodic concerts and folkloric programs. A wide array of traditional music, dance, dress, and handicrafts remain deeply rooted in village and ethnic life.   Cultural institutions The Museum of Guinea-Bissau and the national library are located in Bissau. The National Institute of Studies and Research, also located in Bissau, was among the institutions badly damaged during the fighting of 199899. With international support, a restoration program began in 2000.   Sports and recreation There are many traditional African sports in Guinea-Bissau, but wrestling is among the oldest and most popular. A means of martial arts training and a rite of passage, it is common in villages. The African board game of ouri, a forerunner of backgammon, is played throughout the country. Football (soccer) is the most popular Western sport in Guinea-Bissau. The country features several clubs, and since 1986 its football federation has been a member of the Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Basketball has also developed a following, and the national federation is affiliated with the International Basketball Federation. Diving and swimming are popular on the countrys islands, and excellent fishing conditions can be found in the rivers and coastal areas. Guinea-Bissaus national Olympic committee, which was established in 1992, was recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1995. The country made its Olympic debut at the 1996 Atlanta Games, where it competed in wrestling events.   Media and publishing A number of radio stations operate in Guinea-Bissau. There are a limited number of television stations, including one run by the state. A number of newspapers and periodicals are circulated in the country, including the government newspaper, N Pintcha, and Correio-Bissau, which is distributed weekly. After the overthrow of Pres. Kumba Ial in 2003, media conditions, which had grown repressive, were improved. Lack of financing and power supply are two significant challenges that continue to hinder the growth of Guinea-Bissaus media capabilities.  "},{"CountryName":"Guinea","CulturalInfo":" Government and society  Constitutional framework For more than 25 years under Pres. Skou Tour, Guinea was a one-party state ruled by the Democratic Party of Guinea (Parti Dmocratique de Guine; PDG). In April 1984, after Tours death, a military group led by Lansana Cont abolished the PDG and all associated revolutionary committees and replaced them with the Military Committee for National Recovery (Comit Militaire de Redressement National; CMRN). A new constitution in 1991 began a transition to civilian rule. It provided for a civilian president and a unicameral legislature, the National Assembly; both the president and the legislators were to be elected by universal suffrage for five-year terms. Political parties were legalized in 1992, and Guineas first multiparty elections, in which Cont was elected president, were held in 1993. Cont was reelected in 1998 and 2003. (A national referendum in 2001 amended the constitution to extend the presidential term from five to seven years and to allow for unlimited presidential terms.) After Conts death in December 2008, the country was led by a military junta, which suspended the constitution and dissolved the legislature. It set up a transitional body, the 32-member National Council for Democracy and Development (Conseil National pour la Dmocratie et le Dveloppement; CNDD). The president, succeeded by an interim president from December 2009, of the junta governed the country with the assistance of the CNDD, led by a civilian prime minister. The National Transitional Council (Conseil National de Transition; CNT), a legislative-like body, was formed in February 2010. One of the duties of the CNT was drafting a new constitution, which was promulgated in May 2010. It was succeeded by a new constitution that was passed by a referendum in March 2020 and promulgated in April. Under the 2020 constitution, Guinea is a unitary republic. The constitution provides for a president to serve as the head of state. The president is elected by universal suffrage for a maximum of two six-year terms. A prime minister, who is the head of government, is appointed by the president. Legislators are elected to the unicameral National Assembly by universal suffrage for an unlimited number of five-year terms. The judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, the Court of Audit, and lower courts and tribunals. There is also a Constitutional Court, which presides over constitutional and electoral issues, and a High Court of Justice, which tries the president and other members of government for high treason and other crimes. Following a military coup in September 2021, the 2020 constitution was suspended. A transitional charter presented later that month outlined how the country would be administered until civilian rule was restored. It provided for a president as the head of state, a prime minister as the head of government, and an 81-member National Transitional Council (Conseil National de la Transition; CNT) that would serve as a legislative body.   Health and welfare Since independence the government has made an effort to improve health care services. By the early 21st century infant and child mortality rates were reduced to nearly half of what they had been in the postindependence period. Nevertheless, equipment and supply shortages and an inadequate number of medical personnel continue to hamper the health care system. Most social welfare services are either provided by the extended family or are absent. A severe housing shortage exists in the urbanized areas, though mud and straw construction reduces the problem in rural areas. It is estimated that one-fifth of the countrys population lives in Conakry and its environs, where the housing shortage is especially serious.   Education Educational facilities at all levels declined in the last decade of the Tour government. Private schools, previously banned, were allowed to reopen after Tours death in 1984. Under the 2020 constitution, education is free and compulsory until age 16. Primary education is offered in the form of a six-year program beginning at age seven. Secondary education is also offered as a six-year program. Instruction is offered in French and in local languages. State-controlled institutions of higher education include the University of Conakry (1962) and the University of Kankan (1963). Slightly less than one-third of the population age 15 and older is literate, which is below average for western Africa.   Cultural life  The arts Music is at the heart of Guinean culture and can traditionally be divided into types corresponding to the countrys geographic and ethnolinguistic regions. Although these local styles vary, they are all characterized by heavy use of percussion and string instruments. One of the best-known styles is Manding music, the traditional music of Mande-speaking peoples (the Susu). Its most important instrument is the kora, a harplike instrument made from a dried and hollowed-out gourd. The professional National Guinean Ballet, which emerged after independence, has retained some of the dance and music of the distinct ethnic and regional groups. Creative accomplishments in modern dance and popular music have given Guinean musicians and singers an international reputation. One of the best-known contemporary Guinean musicians is Mory Kant, who has combined traditional sounds with a Western beat. Until 1984 artistic and literary expressions were limited largely to African themes by the single political party and its leader. As a result, Guinean writers of the postindependence period exhibited a strong sense of nationalism. As greater openness of expression returned, a distinctly Guinean literature gradually emerged. Handicrafts in Guinea, as elsewhere in Africa, declined sharply during the colonial era with competition from manufactured consumer goods. The lack of tourism and creative marketing since independence has limited the amount of change and innovation in local crafts, so that the leatherwork, wood carving, and jewelry produced in Guinea tend to be more genuinely ethnic than elsewhere in western Africa.   Media and publishing The government owns or controls Guinean media, and censorship is rigorous. A French-language newspaper, Horoya (Liberty), formerly controlled by the PDG, is published in Conakry, as are a handful of weekly independent newspapers. A number of informal newsletters are also published in indigenous languages. A television service was begun in 1977. After much pressure from international groups, in 2006 the government granted licenses to several private radio stations. Foreign majority ownership in radio, television, and newspapers is restricted, however.   History  Early history Hunting and gathering populations occupied the area of what is now Guinea about 30,000 years ago, and farming has been practiced there for about 3,000 years. About 900 ce the Susu and Malinke (Maninka) began to encroach on the Baga, Koniagi (Coniagui), and Nalu (Nalou) populations who had been living in the area. The towns and villages of Upper Guinea were incorporated into the Mali empire from the mid-13th century, and by the 16th century the Fulani (Fulbe) had established domination over the Fouta Djallon, the mountainous region of what is now west-central Guinea. The Portuguese presence on the coast dates from the 15th century, when they developed a slave trade that would continue to affect Guinea until the mid-19th century. British and French trading interests on the coast played minor roles in the historical evolution of the Guinean interior until the almamy (ruler) of Fouta Djallon placed his country under French protection in 1881. The independent Malinke state, ruled by Samory Tour, resisted the French military until 1898, and isolated small groups of Africans continued to resist the French until the end of World War I (191418).   Colonial era The French protectorate of Rivires du Sud was detached from Senegal as a separate colony in 1890. As French Guinea, it became part of the Federation of French West Africa in 1895. Treaties with Liberia and Great Britain largely established the present boundaries by World War I. Under the 1946 constitution of the French Fourth Republic, a small number of French-educated Africans in Guinea were allowed to vote for deputies to the French National Assembly. In the 1958 referendum on the constitution for the French Fifth Republic, only Guineaunder the influence of Skou Tour, who later became the countrys first presidentvoted against membership in the French Community. Guinea thus became independent.  "},{"CountryName":"Guyana","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Cultural milieu The national social structure was inherited from the period of British colonial rule, under which the majority of Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese labourers were directed by European planters and government officials. A poorly defined local middle class composed of teachers, professionals, and civil servants and including a disproportionate number of Chinese and Portuguese emerged during colonialism. Since independence the elite of the ruling political party has replaced the European plantocracy at the apex of Guyanas social order. Indigenous peoples remain apart from the countrys social structure as they did under the British, but their culture, which remains uninfluenced by national politics, is recognized as an important element in Guyanese museum displays and as an inspiration in local music and art. Daily life and social customs Daily life in Guyana centres on family groups; notably, the matriarchal family among Afro-Guyanese contrasts with the patriarchal Indo-Guyanese family. Daily dress normally does not distinguish one group from another. Guyanas cuisine is a blend of South Asian, South American, and Chinese dishes that make liberal use of fiery locally grown chiles and of fresh tropical fruits and vegetables. A typical dish is pepperpot, a stew made of meat (usually beef, mutton, or pork), potatoes, and peppers laced with cassareep (a sauce concocted from cassava juice and spices). The Guyanese advise that anyone who braves the dish should keep a supply of iced beer and locally produced rums nearby. "},{"CountryName":"Haiti","CulturalInfo":" Housing of HaitiMore than half of the population lives in rural areas. The majority of all rural housing consists of two-room dwellings that have mud walls and floors and roofs that are thatched with local grasses or palm leaves; they may also be constructed with plastic and other materials and roofed with corrugated metal. The windows are paneless and covered with wooden shutters. There is little furniture. In most such dwellings the kitchen is located outside the living quarters, and there is no electricity or piped water; sanitation facilities often consist of a simple latrine dug at a distance from the house. Houses in a typical rural community are built in compounds, whose heads of household are men related through a single male lineage. The houses are built almost exclusively by the male heads of households and their male friends and relatives. In the cities, housing for the majority of people has been similar to that found in the rural areas. Densely populated slums generally consist of ramshackle houses, and the structural integrity of even professionally constructed buildings has suffered from generally lax enforcement of zoning and safety rules. Such endemic infrastructure problems contributed to the devastating effects of the January 2010 earthquake on Port-au-Prince, Logne, and neighbouring cities.   Education Education is officially compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 12, but, because of a lack of facilities and staff, only a small proportion of Haitian children attend school, mostly in private or church-administered institutions. About three-fifths of the adult population is literate; the rate of illiteracy is higher in the countryside than in the cities. The curriculum is based on the French model, and French is the main language of instruction. This system has created a small elite, who have made distinguished cultural contributions. There are dozens of vocational training centres and domestic science schools across the country. The State University of Haiti (founded 1920) has faculties in various health science, economic, and social science disciplines. Quisqueya University (1988) offers similar concentrations but is much smaller. Both universities are in Port-au-Prince. Many students attend universities in Europe and North America.   Cultural life Carnival paradeWomen dancing in a Carnival parade, Port-au-Prince, Haiti.(more)Haitian culture developed out of centuries of slavery and colonialism followed by the victory of newly self-freed slaves over the armies of Napoleon and the establishment of an independent country. Removed from their African roots and having little contact with French culture, Haitians created a distinctive new culture with innovative art, music, dance, and literature. Other influences, in addition to the initial ones from Africa and France, include those from Spanish- and English-speaking areas of the Caribbean and North America. These have been combined and molded by shared experience and hardships of generations of Haitians into contemporary Haitian culture.  Daily life Haitian towns are hives of informal-sector activity, with small workshops, street markets, and food stalls providing thousands of day-to-day jobs. There is no social security or personal income tax in this precarious world, and many children are paid near-starvation wages to perform menial tasks. But many Haitians prefer to take their chance in Port-au-Princes slums rather than eke out a meagre living from remote hillside farms. In the rural areas the hours are even longer and the money scarcer, because eroded and infertile plots produce barely enough food for subsistence. Cash surpluses, when they exist, are invested in land, cattle, or Vodou ceremonies or are used to pay the school fees for children. Few farmers have their own means of transportation. Such hardship is far removed from the lifestyle of Haitis few wealthy elite, who commute from their mountainside villas to air-conditioned offices in costly four-wheel-drive vehicles. Staple foods include beans, rice, sweet potatoes, bananas and plantains, corn (maize), cassava, and taro (a tropical tuber locally known as malang). However, many of Haitis urban poor have difficulty obtaining basic foodstuffs and adequate amounts of potable water. Whenever resources permit, Haitians prepare food with locally grown spices, including thyme, anise, oregano, black pepper, and cloves. Almost every street corner has a stall selling fritay (fried pieces of pork, fish, or plantain) or shaved ice flavoured with sweet cordials.   The arts Haitian visual arts have garnered increasing attention since the 1940s, when a group of self-taught experimental artists developed in Port-au-Prince and Cap-Hatien and opened a workshop, the Centre dArt (1944), in the capital. The movements more highly acclaimed artists have included Wilson Bigaud, the blacksmith and sculptor Georges Liautaud, and the Vodou priests Hector Hyppolite, Andre Pierre, and Robert Saint-Brice. Major galleries in the United States and Europe have exhibited many of their works, which have also influenced the designs of wood carvings and tapestries that are manufactured in Haiti but sold throughout the Caribbean. In the wake of the earthquake of January 2010, the Smithsonian Institution launched a conservation effort that would provide both the sophisticated equipment necessary to restore many of the badly damaged works and conservation training for Haitians. Working together with three U.S. federal agencies and a private organization, in May the Smithsonian assessed the damages to a number of Haitis ruined cultural sites, including the Episcopal Holy Trinity Cathedral (home to a number of murals), the Muse dArt Nader (which held more than 12,000 paintings and sculptures by 20th-century Haitian artists), and the Centre dArt. Musicians in Haiti and the Dominican Republic created the merengue musical style, which combines relatively slow African drum rhythms with early 19th-century European dance music; the merengues popularity has spread throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. More contemporary musical styles have included the rhythmic voodoo beat and the politically minded lyrics of the band Boukman Eksperyans. Haitian literature is written almost exclusively in French; however, some novels, poems, and plays have been written in Creole. Haiti has produced some internationally renowned writers, including Jean Price-Mars, who evaluated the African heritage in Haitian culture; Jacques Roumain, a poet, essayist, and novelist; Jacques-Stephen Alexis, who examined Haitian society through novels and other works; and Ren Depestre, noted for his elegant poetic creations in French. Later Haitian writers, such as Edwidge Danticat, have often written in English about their lives as exiles and their concomitant identity problems.   Cultural institutions Sans Souci Palace, near Cap-Hatien, HaitiThe ruins of Sans Souci Palace, near Cap-Hatien, Haiti.(more)Port-au-Prince, the centre of Haitis cultural and intellectual life, is the site of the National Library (founded 1940), the National Council for Scientific Research (1963), and the major museums and entertainment facilities. The culture of Haiti may be best expressed, however, in the institutionalized festivals. Carnival is celebrated in February prior to Ash Wednesday, as elsewhere in the world, but in a uniquely Haitian manner. Rara, a festival that takes place before Easter, apparently originated in Haiti during the slavery period as a Vodou interpretation of, and slave identification with, the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Rara consists largely of parades with people playing traditional, often homemade, indigenous instruments such as cylindrical bamboo trumpets, though modern instruments such as trumpets and trombones are also used. The songs typically celebrate the African roots of Haitians and are often highly political, usually protesting poverty and oppression. The music at these festivals is a combination of Vodou-based rhythms and rock and roll. The dancing is typically Vodouthat is, wild and somewhat hypnotic. Haitis National History Park, established in 1982 at the time that the UNESCO World Heritage site was designated, is a complex that encompasses the first monuments to be built by newly independent Haiti: Sans Souci Palace (largely destroyed by an earthquake in 1842) and the mountaintop fortress known as the Citadel (Citadelle Laferrire), both constructed under the direction of Henry Christophe in the early 19th century. Two national parks were created in 1983. Macaya Peak National Park, located in the Massif de la Hotte, protects a virgin cloud forest and endangered plants and animals. La Visite National Park, some 12 miles (20 km) southeast of Port-au-Prince, is a forested nature reserve in the Massif de la Selle. The parks exist for the most part only as legal entities, however, as there has been little official control over any of them during the decades of social and political turmoil since their founding, and they have been left open to plant invasion and the establishment of subsistence agriculture within their bounds.   Sports and recreation Haitians do not generally have access to the types of organized recreational activities prevalent in other countries, and sporting facilities are limited. Sports and gambling tend to go hand in hand in Haiti. Card games and dominoes are popular pastimes, but the most passion-inspiring gaming is provided by cockfighting, which takes place every Sunday in almost every village and neighbourhood across the country. Considerable sums of money pass hands at these gatherings, and a successful trainer can become a powerful figure in the community. Another popular form of gambling is borlette, a street-corner lottery found throughout the country. Football (soccer) draws sizable crowds to matches in Port-au-Prince as well as to potholed city streets and rural roads. In 1974 Haiti became the first Caribbean nation to qualify for the World Cup finals, and some Haitian footballers, such as Joe Gaetjens, have played for teams in the United States and Europe. Haitis elite class has produced a handful of international-level tennis players, and cycling is popular among those who can afford bicycles. Swimming is more accessible to ordinary Haitians.   Media and publishing Publishing is limited in Haiti, in part because there are few publishers but also as a result of past political oppression. Few books are published, and, although several daily newspapers operate in Haiti, none circulates more than a few thousand copies. There are several television stations, one of them government-owned, and a number of radio stations whose broadcasts are received throughout the island. Christian Antoine Girault James A.

"},{"CountryName":"Honduras","CulturalInfo":" Administration and social conditions  Government Since acquiring independence in 1821, Honduras has constitutionally been a democratic, representative, unitary state with power divided among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The countrys constitution was rewritten 17 times between the years 1821 and 1982. However, power has often changed hands by violent, undemocratic means. Although the legislature is given the power to pass laws, practically all important legislation is drafted by the president and other members of the executive branch. The National Congress in theory has great authority to check the administrative activities of the president, but only during the period 192531, when several cabinet ministers appointed by the president were forced to resign through censure, was such authority effective. The president, who is head of state and of the government, is elected directly by popular vote for an unrenewable term of four years. The single-house National Congress is composed of 128 legislators elected to four-year terms. The major political parties are the Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras) and the National Party (Partido Nacional). All citizens over 18 years of age are permitted to vote. For purposes of local administration, Honduras is divided into 18 departamentos. Governors are appointed by the president, one for each department, to carry out central government decisions. The departments are divided into municipios (municipalities), which are further partitioned into aldeas (villages, or hamlets). Rural areas are grouped into caseros (settlements), which are subdivisions of aldeas. Localities may elect a mayor, a legal representative, and a council. The justices of the Supreme Court are appointed by the president. The Supreme Court exercises centralized control over the lower courts, including the appointment of justices, and has original and exclusive jurisdiction to declare acts of the legislature unconstitutional.   Education The Honduran educational system follows the European model of centralized control through the Ministry of Public Education. According to law, education is free and, at the primary level, compulsory for all children. Efforts have been made to combat illiteracy, which affects more than one-fourth of the population over age 15 and is especially prevalent among older people. Higher education is centred at the National Autonomous University of Honduras in Tegucigalpa (founded 1847).   Welfare and health By the end of the 20th century, Honduras, like most other Latin American countries, had moved increasingly in the direction of the interventionist, or welfare, state. In 1955 the Honduran basic labour code came into effect, granting the right to work, a minimum wage, an eight-hour workday, the freedom to form labour unions, collective bargaining, conciliation, and the right to strike. Social security and social welfare benefits were not improved appreciably, however: many Honduran workers outside the public sector and not employed by business or industry are not covered. Health care also is generally inadequate for the poor urban and rural labourers. Death rates are high among the lower economic groups, who suffer from two severe health problems in particular, malnutrition and malaria.   Cultural life The art and architecture of the pre-Columbian and Spanish colonial periods are strongly evident in Honduran culture. Of special interest is the great Mayan city of Copn, which represents the height of the Mayan Classic period. Discovered in the early 16th century, Copn was partly excavated and restored in 1839. Spanish architecture reflects Moorish, Gothic, and, especially, Baroque styles. Modern Honduran culture has not produced many strong representatives of its art, the countrys widespread poverty being a major impediment. Most contemporary artists reflect their colonial heritage, and the pre-Columbian heritage is seen mainly in Indian crafts. Social themes may also be reflected in paintings and literary works, the latter generally represented by poetry and short fiction. "},{"CountryName":"Hungary","CulturalInfo":"Higher education Preparation for higher education became virtually universal by the early 1980s, and by the end of that decade about one-fifth of those between ages 18 and 24 were enrolled in one of Hungarys numerous institutions of higher learning, many of them founded or reorganized after World War II. This growth continued even after the communist regime had ended; in 1990 there were only 70,000 full-time and 100,000 part-time college and university students, but by the first decade of the 21st century the number of full- and part-time students had risen to almost 400,000. There was a major reorganization of Hungarian higher education in 2000. Prior to then, traditional major institutions of higher learning were Lornd Etvs University of Budapest, Lajos Kossuth University of Debrecen, Janus Pannonius University of Pcs, Attila Jzsef University of Szeged, the Technical University of Budapest, and the Budapest University of Economic Sciences. There were also dozens of specialized schools and colleges throughout the country. In 2000 most of these specialized colleges were combined with older universities or with one another to form new integrated universities. The result was the birth of the renewed Universities of Debrecen, Pcs, and Szeged; the reorganized Universities of Miskolc and Veszprm; and the newly created St. Stephen University, University of West Hungary of Sopron, and University of Gyr. The main exception to this integration process was in the city of Budapest, where Lornd Etvs University, Semmelweis Medical University, Budapest University of Technology and Economics (formerly Technical University of Budapest), and Budapest University of Economic Sciences and Public Administration (renamed Corvinus University of Budapest in 2004) remained stand-alone universities. In the period after the fall of communism, several private and religious universities were established, including Central European University (CEU) of Budapest, founded by the Hungarian American philanthropist George Soros as an English-language postgraduate institution where the students are introduced to Sir Karl Poppers idea of an open society. Changes to Hungarian law relating to higher education that were enacted in 2017 altered CEUs status as a foreign-registered university. Unable to reach an agreement with the government on that status and arguing that its academic freedom was threatened, CEU responded by relocating its main campus to Vienna. The best-known religious institutions include Pter Pzmny Catholic University and Kroli Gspr  University of the Reformed Church in Hungary. In addition, some of the specialized colleges of music, fine arts, theatre, and military arts were elevated to university status. The postcommunist period also saw the restructuring of the university diplomas. Regular degrees remained, but the university doctorate and the Soviet-inspired candidate (kandidtus)a research degree offered by the Academy of Scienceswere abolished and replaced by an American-style doctorate. At the same time, the habilitation was reintroduced as a prerequisite for university professorships. The science doctorate (tudomnyok doktora), offered by the Academy of Sciences since 1950 and known as the great doctorate (nagydoktortus), remained in force. But, whereas previously it was awarded on the basis of a comprehensive dissertation, it is now given in recognition of major life accomplishments by a very select group of scholars and scientists.Cultural life Cultural milieu National Theatre building, BudapestThe cultural milieu of Hungary is a result of the diverse mix of genuine Hungarian peasant culture and the cosmopolitan culture of an influential German and Jewish urban population. Both the coffeehouse (as meeting place for intellectuals) and the music of the Roma (Gypsies) also have had an impact. Cultural life traditionally has been highly political since national culture became the sine qua non of belated nation building from the early 19th century. Theatre, opera, and literature in particular played crucial roles in developing national consciousness. Poets and writers, especially in crisis situations, became national heroes and prophets. Governments also attempted to influence cultural life through subsidy and regulation. During the state socialist era, culture was strictly controlled; party interference was influenced by ideological principles, and mass culture was promoted. Through much of the 20th century, Hungarian cultural life was characterized by a dichotomy between rural and urban culture and subsequently between populist and urbanist cultureeven though both of the latter were represented by urban-based intellectuals. These intellectuals were divided by their social origins (village versus city) and also by their disagreements about the type of culture that can best serve as the fountainhead of modern Hungarian culture. The populists were suspicious of the urbanists, many of whom were of non-Hungarian origins (mostly German and Jewish), and regarded the village as the depository of true Hungarian culture. The urbanists, on the other hand, viewed the populists as country bumpkins with little appreciation of real culture and looked to western European cultural centres as sources for their own version of modern Hungarian culture. "},{"CountryName":"Iceland","CulturalInfo":"Government and society Constitutional framework Icelands constitution, which was adopted in 1944, established a parliamentary democracy with a directly elected president as head of state. The powers of the president are similar to those of other heads of state in western European democracies. Real power rests with the 63-member parliament, the Althingi (Althing). One of the oldest legislative assemblies in the world, it is a unicameral legislature in which members serve four-year terms unless parliament is dissolved and new elections called. The executive branch is headed by a cabinet that must maintain majority support in parliamentor at least avoid censureotherwise it must resign. Citizens are guaranteed the civil rights customary in Western democracies. Local government Local government in Iceland is chiefly responsible for primary education, municipal services, and the administration of social programs. The country is divided into 17 provinces (sslur), which are further subdivided into fewer than 100 municipalities. Since the 1970s their number has decreased by nearly half as a result of consolidation. Each municipality administers local matters through an elected council. Justice The judiciary consists of a supreme court and a system of lower courts, most of which hear both civil and criminal cases. Cases are heard and decided by appointed judges; there is no jury system. Political process The president, Althing, and local councils are elected every four years, but not necessarily all at once. All citizens 18 years of age and older may vote. Members of the Althing are selected by proportional representation in multimember constituencies. Since the late 1970s the Independence Party (1929), centre to conservative in political outlook, has commanded about one-third to two-fifths of the popular vote, and it frequently formed coalition governments. The Progressive Party (1916), which generally has been the second leading party during this period, draws its strength from rural areas. In 2000 three left-of-centre partiesthe Social Democratic Party (1916), the Peoples Alliance (1956), and the Womens Alliance (1983)came together to become another major player, the Social Democratic Alliance. The Left-Green Party (1998) also grew in importance. In 1980 Vigds Finnbogadttir became the first woman president, a position she held for four consecutive terms until her retirement in 1996. In 2009 Jhanna Sigurardttir became Icelands first woman prime minister and the worlds first openly gay head of government. Security With the exception of a small coast guard, Iceland does not have military forces. However, in 1949 it became a charter member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Iceland joined the United Nations in 1946, a year after its founding. In the post-World War II period it has based its foreign policy on peaceful international cooperation and participated in joint Western defense efforts. The United States, having assumed responsibility for Icelands defense, maintains a naval air station at Keflavk International Airport under NATO auspices. Health and welfare Iceland, with compulsory health insurance that finances most medical services, has a high standard of public health and one of the highest life expectancies in the world. Hospital inpatient services are provided entirely without charge, other medical services at low cost. Dental care is partially subsidized for children up to age 16 and for retirees with low incomes. Heart disease and cancer together account for about one-half of all deaths. Welfare services include unemployment insurance, old-age and disability pensions, family and childbearing allowances, and sickness benefits. The medical and welfare systems are financed through taxation by central and local government. Housing More than four-fifths of homes have been built since the countrys independence in 1944. Homes are relatively large in comparison with those in other countries, particularly because the countrys historically high inflation encourages people to invest in housing. Housing shortages were acute in the 1960s. However, because of a housing boom beginning in 1970, housing shortages largely have been alleviated. Education Almost all schools from the primary level through the university are free. Education is compulsory through age 16, and secondary and higher education is widely available. Students can enroll in four-year academic colleges at the age of 15 or 16. Graduation from one of these colleges entitles the student to admission to the University of Iceland, founded in 1911, in Reykjavk. A second university was established at Akureyri in 1987. Since then, several other schools have elevated their curriculum to the university level and offer university-level degrees. There are also a number of technical, vocational, and specialized schools.Cultural life Icelanders are proof that a small and homogeneous population can develop a rich and varied cultural life. The countrys literary heritage stems from writers of the 12th to 14th centuries who vividly recorded the sagas of Icelands first 250 years. Other traditional arts include weaving, silver crafting, and wood carving. The Reykjavk area, which supports several professional theatres, a symphony orchestra, an opera, and a number of art galleries, bookstores, cinemas, and museums, has a cultural environment that compares favourably with those of cities several times its size. It also holds a biennial international art festival. Daily life and social customs Icelands character reflects both its homogeneity and its isolation, and its people take care to preserve their traditions and language by, among other things, using native terms for introduced objectsfor example, the Icelandic word for computer, tlva, combines ancient terms for number and seer. Icelanders are generally reserved and confident, and, though sometimes wary of foreigners, they are friendly hosts. For centuries Iceland has been known for its traditional industries, which produce knitwear and other ancestral crafts. As in most Scandinavian countries, women have long occupied a prominent place in society, especially in government. There are many national and local festivals. The largest is the annual Independence Day celebration marking the countrys independence in 1944. The Sumardargurinn Fyrsti festival celebrates the first day of summer, and each June the Sjmannadagurinn pays tribute to Icelands seafaring past. The Reykjavk Arts Festival attracts many to the city. Icelandic cuisine centres on the countrys fishing industry. Hkarl (carefully putrefied shark) is a pungent traditional food. Cod, haddock, whale blubber, and seal meat are available. Other traditional dishes include gravlax (salmon marinated in salt and dill), hangikjt (smoked lamb), hrtspungar (rams testicles), and sltur, a haggis-like dish made of sheep entrails. The skyr, which is made of cultured skim milk, is a distinctive Icelandic dessert, served with fresh bilberries in summer. Coffee seems omnipresent, and a unique Icelandic liquor is brennivn, which is made from potatoes and caraway. "},{"CountryName":"India","CulturalInfo":" Health and welfare Indias medical and public health services have improved dramatically since independence. As a result, average life expectancy at birth has risen by more than 25 years since World War II, although it still lags behind expectancies in the worlds more affluent societies. While death from starvation has become rare, malnutrition has remained widespread. Much of the population lacks access to safe drinking water, seasonally if not year-round. Dysentery and other diseases caused by waterborne organisms are major killers, especially of children. Poorly treated and improperly disposed sewage pose serious health problems. Most diseases endemic to tropical regions are significant causes of morbidity in India. The rate of tuberculosis is high, and the incidence of blindness, mainly caused by trachoma, is even higher. Great strides, however, have been made in combating certain diseases. Smallpox, once a leading cause of death, was declared eradicated in 1977. The vigorous National Malaria Eradication Programme, launched in 1958, almost succeeded in ridding India of this once very common disease, but the development of resistance to DDT among mosquitoes caused a resurgence of the problem. This led to renewed public health efforts and, subsequently, to a slow but steady decline in the number of affected individuals. AIDS and HIV infection have increased; although the overall proportion of the population affected is quite tiny, the number of people infected is one of the highest for any country in the world. Apart from numerous programs directed against specific diseases, there has been a considerable expansion in the number of union- and state-maintained hospitals and rural primary health centres. The latter generally are staffed by minimally trained paramedical personnel and are poorly equipped. Many are visited each week by a trained government doctor. Supplementing these government services are private medical practitioners, a great many of whom follow a variety of traditional medical systems. Of these, the ancient Ayurvedic system is by far the most widespread. Several dozen colleges teach Ayurvedic medicine, often with government support. Throughout India, the government uses its network of hospitals and clinics for immunizing children against various diseases and for promoting family planning. Family planning efforts, including the encouragement of voluntary sterilization of both males and females, have met with mixed success. Welfare services have proliferated in number and type since independence. Many programs target specific sections of the population, such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, nomadic populations, women, children, and the disabled. The resources for such services, however, are inadequate, and a large proportion of the budgets for specific programs goes toward maintaining the service staff and their generally meagre facilities. Pension plans for retirees exist only for government workers and a portion of the organized sector of the economy.   Housing Mumbai, India: Dhobi GhatDhobi Ghat, an outdoor laundromat in Mumbai (Bombay), India.(more)Existing housing stock does not meet Indias current needs and is continually challenged by the countrys growing population. Homelessness is common, particularly in major urban centres, and large numbers of city dwellers reside in unregistered and makeshift slums. Housing prices in the largest citiesDelhi, Kolkata, and Mumbaiare among the highest in the world, and even modest apartments are beyond the means of many residents. Despite government efforts to alleviate these problems, relatively few government housing projects have been undertaken. Rural housing is somewhat less pressed, despite the fact that most of the countrys population continues to live in the countryside. Traditional building materials vary from region to region; adobe edifices are common in arid regions, for example, and high-roofed thatch buildings are standard in areas with greater annual precipitation. These are often augmented with walls and roofs made of such materials as sheet metal, cinder blocks, or stone. Throughout the country, the use of materials such as concrete, blocks, and stucco has become common in more affluent villages, towns, and cities. Piped water is mainly limited to large towns and cities, but even there it seldom reaches all neighbourhoods and cannot be depended on in all seasons. Otherwise, reliance is on wells, rivers, reservoirs, and tanks (usually inundated borrow pits), with minimal, if any, treatment. Sewage facilities are even more limited. Professional scavengers, publicly and privately employed, fill the need for waste disposal in most urban areas and, along with pigs, in many villages as well. Piped gas is a rarity. Those who cook with gas generally rely on purchased gas cylinders. An increasing number of villages, however, have installed simple cow-dung gas plants, which enable them to generate methane and still utilize the fermented dung for fertilizer.   Education Chandigarh, India: Punjab University libraryLibrary building of Punjab University, Chandigarh, India.(more)The provision of free and compulsory education for all children up to age 14 is among the directive principles of the Indian constitution. The overall rate of literacy has increased markedly since the late 20th century, but a noticeable disparity has remained between males and females (roughly three-fourths and about half, respectively). There is also a considerable disparity in literacy rates between the states. The state of Kerala has the highest rate, where nearly all are literate, in contrast to Bihar, where the proportion is about half. Preuniversity education generally consists of five years of primary education (classes I through V), normally for pupils aged 6 to 11; middle level (classes VI through VIII); lower secondary (classes IX and X); and higher secondary (classes XI to XII). The great majority of all children of primary-school age are enrolled, though many, especially girls, may not attend regularly. Enrollment thereafter falls off precipitously, to about half of all children aged 11 to 14, despite the fact that education is free in most states for students of both sexes at least until class X. Formerly a state responsibility, education was made a joint responsibility of the union and state governments by constitutional amendment. The union government has subsequently played a larger role in promoting the education of girls and other socially disadvantaged groups, largely through fiscal grants for the support of particular programs (e.g., reimbursement of tuition, where it is charged, for girls in classes IXXII), and in launching a variety of progressive educational initiatives. In addition to publicly financed schools, there are at all levels private and church-run schools (largely by Christian missions), for which tuition is required. Entrance into these often prestigious, predominantly English-language institutions is eagerly sought for the children of those parents who can afford them. Vadodara, Gujarat, India: Maharaja Sayajirao University of BarodaThe Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda at Vadodara, Gujarat, India.(more)Ahmadabad, India: Indian Institute of ManagementIndian Institute of Management, Ahmadabad, India, designed by Louis Kahn.(more)Numerous key universities, institutes of technology, and other specialized institutions of higher education are under union government control, while a much larger number of universities are controlled by the state governments. A disproportionate share of Indias total educational budget goes toward higher education. The number of universities and equivalent institutions increased more than sevenfold in the first four decades after independence, while the number of students enrolled increased more than 15 times during the same period. Each of those numbers has continued to grow dramatically since then. At the same time, funding for libraries, laboratories, and other facilities has been a constant and serious problem. Critics of the unabated growth of higher education have asserted that the quality of university education has steadily declined and have noted the increasingly large proportion of graduates who are unable to find employment, especially among those with liberal arts degrees. Among the established universities are three founded by the British in 1857, at Kolkata, Mumbai, and Chennai. In the past, virtually all higher instruction was in English, but, as new universities and their thousands of affiliated colleges have spread out to smaller cities and towns, state languages increasingly have been used, notwithstanding the paucity of textbooks in such languages. Reserved quotas in universities and lower admission standards for members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribeswhose prior education often has been less than adequatehave put additional stress on the system. The fact that Indias best students often take their higher degrees abroad, many never to return, further exacerbates the problem of quality. Nevertheless, elite institutions continue to exist, and, in absolute terms, the output of well-educated individuals is substantial.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu India is a large and diverse polyglot nation whose tempo of life varies from region to region and from community to community. By the early 21st century the lifestyle of middle-class and affluent urban families differed little from that of urbanites in Europe, East Asia, or the Americas. For the most part, however, the flow of rural life continued much as it always had. Many small villages remained isolated from most forms of media and communications, and work was largely done by hand or by the use of animal power. Traditional forms of work and recreation only slowly have given way to habits and pastimes imported from the outside world. The pace of globalization was slow in much of rural India, and even in urban areas Western tastes in food, dress, and entertainment were adopted with discrimination. Indian fashions have remained the norm; Indians have continued to prefer traditional cuisine to Western fare; and, though Indian youths are as obsessed as those in the West with pop culture, Indians produce their own films and music (albeit, strongly influenced by Western styles), which have been extremely popular domestically and have been successfully marketed abroad. Throughout India, custom and religious ritual are still widely observed and practiced. Among Hindus, religious and social custom follows the samskara, a series of personal sacraments and rites conducted at various stages throughout life. Observant members of other confessional communities follow their own rites and rituals. Among all groups, caste protocols have continued to play a role in enforcing norms and values, despite decades of state legislation to alleviate caste bias.  "},{"CountryName":"Indonesia","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Cultural milieu Indonesia exhibits a rich diversity of cultural practices and products. The remote interior regions of Sumatra, Kalimantan, and western New Guinea feature ritualized speech and local epic narrative traditions, while in Java and Bali the visual and performing arts are heavily influenced by the Hindu epics Mahabharata and Ramayana. In the cities, the mellifluous calls to prayer radiating from mosques, many of which display a markedly Muslim architectural style, coexist with the flashing lights and vibrant sounds of urban popular culture. These are just a few examples of Indonesias truly complex heritage. BorobudurBorobudur, a 9th-century Buddhist monument, Central Java, Indon.(more)The aura of long-gone Hindu-Buddhist empires lingers in many parts of Indonesia, particularly in Java, Sumatra, and Bali. From the 8th through the 10th century ce, extensive temple complexes (candi) were built in central Java. Most of these were buried or in ruins, but the government has actively engaged in their restoration. The remains of the first of the great central Javanese monuments, the Shaivite temple of the Diyeng (Dieng) Plateau, date to the early 8th century. The Shailendra dynasty, which ruled Java and Sumatra (8th9th centuries), built the great Mahayana Buddhist monuments, including that of Borobudur. Late in the 9th century the kings of Mataram built the Hindu monuments around Prambanan. Commonly called Prambanan Temple, the complex consists of six main temples; the three large ones along the west, dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma, contain fine statues. Of the three smaller temples along the east, the middle one contains a statue of Nandi, the bull of Shiva. The main temples are heavily ornamented with stone carvings of the gods and other heavenly beings, and there is a series of relief panels depicting the Ramayana. Borobudur, IndonesiaPathway on one of the terraces of Borobudur, central Java, Indonesia.(more)Borobudur, designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1991, is one of the finest Buddhist monuments in the world. It stands on a hill about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Yogyakarta and rises to a height of approximately 115 feet (35 metres) from its square base, which measures 403 feet (123 metres) on each side. The monument consists of a lower structure of six square terraces (including its base) and an upper structure of three circular terraces, combining the ancient symbols of the circle for the heavens and the square for the earth. In the centre of each side of the square terraces is a staircase leading to the next level. The inner wall on each level has niches containing statues of Buddha. Bas-reliefs covering the inner walls and the balustrades depict stories from Buddhist teachings; many of the images symbolize phases of human life, moving from the sensual stage at the lower level to the spiritual stage at the top. The circular terraces are not decorated but contain 72 bell-shaped stupas, each housing a statue of Buddha. In the centre of the upper terrace is the main stupa, which stands 23 feet (7 metres) high. It contains no statues, other visual images, or relics of any kind. Between the 10th and 16th centuries, the centre of power in the archipelago shifted to eastern Java, and Buddhism merged with Hinduism, which later gave way to Islam. Literature in old Javanese (kawi) flourished during this period, and a number of large temple complexes were constructed, none of which, however, approached the grandeur of Borobudur or Prambanan. The most imposing complex is Panataran Temple near Blitar, which was constructed at the peak of the Majapahit empire in the 14th century. With the ascendancy of Islam through the 15th and 16th centuries, the temples fell into ruins, and Hindu culture shifted to Bali, where it remains today. The arts Literature Indonesia possesses a wealth of verbal art. Much of this material, such as the didong poetry of Aceh or the tekena epic tales of the Kenyah of Kalimantan, is transmitted through oral-traditional performance, as opposed to printed text. A largely nonwritten tradition of reciting expressive, often witty quatrains called pantun is common in most Malay areas throughout the archipelago. Some pantun performances are narrative; the kentrung traditions of central and eastern Java, for instance, use pantun structure to recount religious or local historical tales to the accompaniment of a drum. In central Java macapat, a metric and melodic form, is used to present tales from ancient Hindu-Javanese literature as well as stories, images, and ideas from local sources; the songs may be performed solo or with instrumental accompaniment. Indeed, much of Indonesias traditional literature forms the foundation of complex mixed-genre performances, such as the randai of the Minangkabau of western Sumatra, which blends instrumental music, dance, drama, and martial arts in ceremonial settings. Contemporary Indonesian literature was initiated in the early 1930s by a small group of young writers, who created the journal Poedjangga Baroe (The New Writer). Published in the Indonesian language, as opposed to Dutch, this literary periodical was devoted to disseminating new ideas and expressions that ran counter to the type of writing sanctioned by the colonial government. Under the intellectual leadership of S. Takdir Alisjahbana, a poet, novelist, and philosopher, the contributors to Poedjangga Baroe were committed to the nationalist causeto the establishment of a new, modern Indonesia, free from the constraints of local patterns of cultural expression. The true modernist temper, however, emerged in the works of Indonesian poets of the early 1940s, with Chairil Anwar as the leading figure. Although he died young, Chairil transformed the Indonesian literary scene through the intense imagery of his poetry and through his rebellious stance toward religion and social convention. The growth of Indonesian literature suffered some setbacks in the second half of the 20th century under the Sukarno and Suharto regimes, both of which imposed restrictions on literary activity. Some writers, such as the internationally recognized novelist and journalist Mochtar Lubis, were jailed for their nonconformity to governmental ideals and policies. A cinematic work based on a novel by Alisjahbana was prohibited; Alisjahbana later left the country to live in Malaysia. Especially during the first half of the Suharto administration, politically liberal writers were imprisoned; the renowned novelist Pramoedya Ananta Toer was detained for more than a decade. Despite some tumultuous moments in its history, Indonesian literature has remained vibrant. Literary groups in the larger cities often publish local poetic works. Jakarta produces two of the most prestigious journals of letters and ideas: Horison (Horizon), published since 1966, and Kalam (The Word), published since 1994. "},{"CountryName":"Iran","CulturalInfo":" Education of IranEducation is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 11. Roughly four-fifths of men and two-thirds of women are literate. Primary education is followed by a three-year guidance cycle, which assesses students aptitudes and determines whether they will enter an academic, scientific, or vocational program during high school. Policy changes initiated since the revolution eliminated coeducational schools and required all schools and universities to promote Islamic values. The latter is a reaction to the strong current of Western secularism that permeated higher education under the monarchy. Adherence to the prevalent political dogma has long been an important factor for students and faculty who wish to succeed in Iranian universities. In fact, acceptance to universities in Iran is largely based on a candidates personal piety, either real or perceived. The University of Tehrn was founded in 1934, and several more universities, teachers colleges, and technical schools have been established since then. Irans institutes of higher learning suffered after the revolution, however, when tens of thousands of professors and instructors either fled the country or were dismissed because of their secularism or association with the monarchy. Irans universities have remained understaffed, and thus student enrollment has dropped in a country that greatly esteems higher education. The shortage of skilled teachers has led the government to encourage students to study abroad, in an effort to improve the quality and quantity of advanced degree holders and faculty. While overall enrollment numbers have fallen, the rate of womens admission at the university level has climbed dramatically, and by 2000 more than half of incoming students were women. The public school system is controlled by the Ministry of Education and Training. Universities are under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education and Culture, and medical schools are under the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Few countries enjoy such a long cultural heritage as does Iran, and few people are so aware of and articulate about their deep cultural tradition as are the Iranians. Iran, or Persia, as a historical entity, dates to the time of the Achaemenids (about 2,500 years ago), and, despite political, religious, and historic changes, Iranians maintain a deep connection to their past. Although daily life in modern Iran is closely interwoven with Shii Islam, the countrys art, literature, and architecture are an ever-present reminder of its deep national tradition and of a broader literary culture that during the premodern period spread throughout the Middle East and South Asia. Much of Irans modern history can be attributed to the essential tension that existed between the Shii piety promoted by Irans clergy and the Persian cultural legacyin which religion played a subordinate roleproffered by the Pahlavi monarchy. Despite the predominance of Persian culture, Iran remains a multiethnic state, and the countrys Armenian, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, and smaller ethnic minorities each have their own literary and historical traditions dating back many centuries, evenin the case of the Armeniansto the pre-Christian era. These groups frequently maintain close connections with the larger cultural life of their kindred outside Iran.  "},{"CountryName":"Iraq","CulturalInfo":" Education of IraqThe Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research have been responsible for the rapid expansion of education since the 1958 revolution. The number of qualified scientists, administrators, technicians, and skilled workers in Iraq traditionally has been among the highest in the Middle East. Education at all levels is funded by the state. Primary education (ages 6 to 12) is compulsory, and secondary education (ages 12 to 18) is widely available. At one time many Iraqi students went abroad, particularly to the United States and Europe, for university and graduate training, but this became rare following the Persian Gulf War. Iraqi girls have also been afforded good opportunities in education, and at times the rate of female university graduates has exceeded that of males. Beginning in the early 1990s, however, enrollment, for both boys and girls, fell considerably at all levels as many were forced to leave school and enter the workforce. Moreover, lacking access to the latest texts and equipment, Iraqi schools slowly fell behind those of other countries in the region in terms of the quality of education they offered. The educational system had formerly been highly politicized, and, following the fall of the Baath Party, an entirely different approach was encouraged by the new government. The educational system still suffers from personnel and funding shortages.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu The fundamental cultural milieu of Iraq is both Islamic and Arab and shares many of the customs and traditions of the Arab world as a whole. Within Iraq, however, there is rich cultural diversity. A variety of peoples were embraced by Iraq when it was carved out of the Ottoman Empire in 1920. These included the nomadic tribes of the arid south and west (related to the Bedouin of neighbouring states), the peasant farmers of central Iraq, the marsh dwellers of the south, the dryland cultivators of the northeast, and the mountain herders of Kurdistan. Adaptations to these contrasting environments have generated a mosaic of distinctive regional cultures manifested in folk customs, food, dress, and domestic architecture. Such regional differences are reinforced by the ethno-religious contrasts between Kurds and Arabs and by the fundamental division within Islam between the Shiah and Sunnis. These divisions are less marked than they were in the early 20th century but are still evident in the human geography of Iraq.   Daily life and social customs War always ravages daily life, and, following the start of the Iraq War, there were few aspects of daily social interaction that were unaffected by the shortages of water and electricity, damaged infrastructure, soaring unemployment, collapse of government facilities, or violence of postwar guerrilla action. In broader terms, however, over the course of the 20th century, one development was evident: rapid urban growth accelerated social change in Iraq as a higher proportion of the population was exposed to modern, largely Westernized, lifestyles. Traditional social relationships, in which the family, the extended family, and the tribe are the prime focus, have remained fundamentally important in rural areas but are under pressure in the towns. Alcoholic beverages and Western-style entertainment have become freely available, a circumstance much deplored by devout Muslims. Although the number of Muslims in Iraq embracing a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam has grownas it has elsewhere in the Middle EastIslamic extremism has not presented a major social or political problem, given the nature of the former regime. The role of women has been changing, with a higher proportion participating in the labour force in spite of encouragement from the government to stay at home and raise large families. Although Iraqis generally are a religious and conservative people, there are strong secular tendencies in the country. This is reflected in the dress, which, while conservative by Western standards (short or revealing clothes for men or women are considered inappropriate), is quite relaxed by the standards of the region, particularly compared with neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states. Men will frequently wear Western-style suits or, in more casual surroundings, the long shirtlike thawb. The traditional chador and veil, the ijab, is common among conservative womenespecially those from rural areasbut Western attire is common. Iraqi cuisine mirrors that of Syria and Lebanon, with strong influences from the culinary traditions of Turkey and Iran. As in other parts of the Middle East, chicken and lamb are favourite meats and are often marinated with garlic, lemon, and spices and grilled over charcoal. Flatbread is a staple that is served, with a variety of dips, cheeses, olives, and jams, at every meal. Fruits and vegetables are also staples, particularly the renowned Iraqi dates, which are plentiful, sweet, and delicious and, along with coffee, are served at the end of almost every meal.  "},{"CountryName":"Ireland","CulturalInfo":" Security of IrelandIreland has no local police forces. The Guardians of the Peace (An Garda Sochna), established in 1922, is a nationwide force headed by a commissioner who is responsible to the minister for justice. A few hundred members of the force are assigned to detective duties; they are usually plainclothes officers and, when necessary, are armed. The rest of the force is uniformed and does not carry firearms. Irelands defense forces, which include both active-duty and reserve components, are made up largely of army personnel, although the country also maintains small naval and air forces. The Irish armed forces are mainly organized around their external mission; however, they do play a residual role in what they call on-island security. Under the constitution, the president is the supreme commander of the armed forces; however, the prime minister effectively oversees the military through the minister for defense and a defense council. Irish forces, including the air corps and the naval service, have played an active part in United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations. In the late 20th century, Irish officers or forces served in UN missions to such places as Lebanon and other areas of the Middle East, Afghanistan, Congo (Kinshasa), Cyprus, and the Balkans. There is no conscription; enlistment in the defense forces and the reserve force is voluntary. Ireland has struggled with its dual commitments to its historical tradition of neutrality and to its obligations to the European Union, which include defense elements.   Health and welfare Health services are administered by eight regional health boards under the general supervision of the Department of Health and Children. Health examinations, child welfare clinics, and the treatment of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases are available to all without charge. Otherwise, the cost of public health services depends on the patients means. Persons who cannot afford to pay are entitled to a comprehensive health service free of charge. A middle-income groupinsured workers, smaller farmers, and others of restricted meansis entitled to a free maternity and child welfare service and to free hospital and specialist services. Those who are more affluent normally arrange and pay for their own medical advice and hospital services, but a voluntary health insurance program was established by law in 1957. Owing in large measure to the world-famous Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes (193087), a large lottery that was promoted internationally, the republic developed an excellent system of hospitals. Pay-related social insurance is paid by most employees age 16 and over. Benefits include widows and orphans pensions, unemployment and disability benefits, deserted wives allowances, and old-age pensions. The indigent receive certain benefits on a noncontributory basis. These include widows and orphans pensions, old-age pensions, home assistance, unemployment assistance, and pensions for those disabled or blind. Childrens allowances are paid to all households for each child under age 16, irrespective of means. Ireland is a signatory to international agreements on human rights, and capital punishment has been outlawed. Because of the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, Ireland historically has had strict social laws (e.g., abortion is illegal). However, referenda in the 1980s and 90s resulted in some reforms, including the legalization of divorce and contraception. In 2010 the European Court on Human Rights found Irelands abortion policies to be in violation of European standards of human rights.   Housing Eyeries, County Cork, IrelandHouses in Eyeries, County Cork, Ireland.(more)Compared with much of western Europe, Ireland has very high rates of home ownership. Whereas fewer than one-tenth of units were owned by their occupants when the country became independent in 1922, by the beginning of the 21st century, roughly four-fifths of units were owner-occupied. The housing stock in the country is relatively modern, with many units built since the 1970s. However, there have been housing shortages, and the waiting list for public housing units nearly doubled during the 1990s. Meanwhile, prices for homes rose dramatically as home ownership became a largely unfunded property bubble that played an important role in the Irish financial crisis of 2008. In the wake of that crisis, housing prices fell precipitously.   Education Long Room, Old Library, Trinity College DublinThe Long Room in the Old Library, Trinity College  Dublin.(more)Primary education is free, compulsory, and almost entirely religious denominational. There are several state-aided teachers colleges. The secondary-school system comprises private schools that are predominantly owned by religious communities but receive most of their funding from the state; comprehensive and community schools, which are completely state-owned; and vocational schools, which provide academic as well as vocational courses leading to qualifications in architecture, accountancy, engineering, computing, electronics, and similar professions. There are also a growing number of multidenominational private schools in Ireland operated by the Educate Together organization. The vocational education system includes schools of art, music, domestic science, and hotel training. A number of regional technical colleges provide advanced vocational courses. Students graduating from the state-aided teachers colleges often receive university degrees. University education is provided at the University of Dublin (Trinity College), founded in 1592, and at the National University of Ireland, founded in 1908. The latter has constituent universities at Dublin, Cork, Galway, and Maynooth, as well as several associated colleges. In 1989 the national institutes for higher education in Limerick and Dublin, which emphasized applied studies in varied flexible course structures, were given university status and renamed the University of Limerick and the Dublin City University. The Higher Education Authority was established in 1972 to deal with the financial and organizational problems of higher education. Education is highly valued in Ireland, which is sometimes called the Land of Saints and Scholars, and the strength of Irish education was often cited as a major contributor to the takeoff of the Celtic Tiger economy in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, concerns about the Irish education system were raised when Irelands national literacy ranking fell from 5th in the world in 2000 to 17th in 2010. Still, Ireland continues to see its higher education as a major asset, and the government has emphasized research and development as part of its attempt to create a sustainable economy.   Cultural life The cultural milieu of Ireland has been shaped by the dynamic interplay between the ancient Celtic traditions of the people and those imposed on them from outside, notably from Britain. This has produced a culture of rich, distinctive character in which the use of languagebe it Irish or Englishhas always been the central element. Not surprisingly, Irish culture is best known through its literature, drama, and songs; above all, the Irish are renowned as masters of the art of conversation. Use of the Irish language declined steadily during the 19th century and was nearly wiped out by the Great Famine of the 1840s and subsequent emigration, which particularly affected the Irish-speaking population in the western portion of the countrythe area beyond the pale (i.e., beyond the English-speaking and English-controlled area around Dublin). From the mid-19th century, in the years following the famine, there was a resurgence in Irish language and traditional culture. This Gaelic revival led in turn to the Irish literary renaissance of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in which native expression was explored and renewed by a generation of writers and academics. It also produced a resurgence in traditional musical and dance forms. The cultural revivalism became an inspiration to the Irish nationalist struggle of the early decades of the 20th century. Partly because of government subsidies and programs, traditional cultural activities, especially the use of the Irish language and the revival of arts and crafts, have increased.

The intermingling of the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Middle Eastern traditions has been of profound importance in forging modern Israel; however, the arrival of immigrants from Russia and other former Soviet republics has slowed the trend, common among immigrants from central Europe and America, toward creating a cultural synthesis embracing East, West, and native Israeli society. The revival of the Hebrew language, not spoken since biblical times, has also been of great importance in the development of Israels modern culture. This diverse cultural heritage and shared language, along with a common Jewish tradition, both religious and historical, form the foundation of cultural life in Israel.  "},{"CountryName":"Italy","CulturalInfo":"Education of ItalyThe constitution guarantees the freedom of art, science, and teaching. It also provides for state schools and guarantees the independence of the universities. Private schools (mainly run by religious bodies) are permitted. The constitution further states that the public schools are open to all and makes provision for scholarships and grants. Education is compulsory only for those age 6 to 16 years. The school system begins with kindergarten for the 3- to 6-year-olds. Primary schools are attended by children between the ages of 6 and 11, at which stage most go on to secondary schools for 11- to 14-year-olds, but those wishing to study music go directly to the conservatories. Postsecondary schooling is not compulsory and includes a wide range of technical and trade schools, art schools, teacher-training schools, and scientific and humanistic preparatory schools. Pupils from these schools can then continue their education attending either non-university- or university-level courses. University education is composed of three levels. At the first level, it takes between two and three years to gain a diploma. At the second level, between four and six years are spent to gain a university degree. At the third level, specialized courses of two to five years duration or doctorate courses lasting three to four years are offered. At the beginning of the 21st century, more than one-third of the population had a high school diploma, about one-third had a junior high school diploma, and more than one-tenth had obtained a college degree. But educational attainment is higher in the younger generations. About two-thirds of people of university age attend university, and almost nine-tenths of people of high school age attend high school. Most schools and universities are run by the state, with programs that are uniform across the country. Less than one-tenth of students attend private schools.

Although the country was politically unified in 1861, regional identity remains strong, and the nation has developed unevenly as a cultural entity. Many regional differences are lessening with the increasing influence of television and other mass media as well as a nationally shared school curriculum. Though Italians have long tended to consider themselves citizens of their town or city first, followed by their region or province and so on, this is changing as Italy becomes more closely integrated into the European Union (EU) and as Italians come to think of themselves as part of a supranational community made up of many peoples. "},{"CountryName":"Jamaica","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Jamaicas cultural development has been deeply influenced by British traditions and a search for roots in folk forms. The latter are based chiefly on the colourful rhythmic intensity of the islands African heritage. Cultural milieu Jamaican culture is a product of the interaction between Europe and Africa. Terms such as Afro-centred and Euro-centred, however, are often used to denote the perceived duality in Jamaican cultural traditions and values. European influences persist in public institutions, medicine, Christian worship, and the arts. However, African continuities are present in religious life, Jamaican Creole language, cuisine, proverbs, drumming, the rhythms of Jamaican music and dance, traditional medicine (linked to herbal and spiritual healing), and tales of Anansi, the spider-trickster. Daily life and social customs Family life is central to most Jamaicans, although formal marriages are less prevalent than in most other countries. It is common for three generations to share a home. Many women earn wages, particularly in households where men are absent, and grandmothers normally take charge of preschool-age children. Wealthier Jamaican families usually employ at least one domestic helper. The main meal is almost always in the evening, because most people do not have time to prepare a midday meal and children normally eat at school. Families tend to be too busy to share most weekday dinners, but on Sundays tradition dictates that even poor families enjoy a large and sociable brunch or lunch, usually including chicken, fish, yams, fried plantains, and the ubiquitous rice and peas (rice with kidney beans or gungo [pigeon] peas). One of Jamaicas most popular foods is jerk (spiced and grilled) meat. Clothing styles vary. Rastafarians, who account for a tiny part of the population, typically wear loose-fitting clothing and long dreadlocks, a hairstyle associated with the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie I in the early 20th century. Jamaican independence from Great Britain (August 6, 1962) is commemorated annually. The government sponsors Festival as part of the independence celebrations. Although it has much in common with the regions pre-Lenten Carnivals, Festival is much wider in scope, including street dancing and parades, arts and crafts exhibitions, and literary, theatrical, and musical competitions. Since the late 20th century, Jamaicans have also celebrated Carnival, typically with costumed parades, bands, and dancing. Emancipation Day is celebrated on August 1. "},{"CountryName":"Japan","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Cultural milieu Influences It is common for Western observers of contemporary Japan to emphasize its great economic achievement without equal regard to cultural attributes. Yet Japanese cultural distinctiveness and the manner in which it developed are instructive in understanding how it is that Japan came to be the first non-Western country to attain great-power status. The Japanese long have been intensely aware of and have responded with great curiosity to powerful outside influences, first from the Asian mainland (notably China) and more recently from the Western world. Japan has followed a cycle of selectively absorbing foreign cultural values and institutions and then adapting these to existing indigenous patterns, this latter process often occurring during periods of relative political isolation. Thus, outside influences were assimilated, but the basic sense of Japaneseness was unaffected; for example, Buddhist deities were adopted into the Shint pantheon. Japans effort to modernize quickly in the late 19th and 20th centuriesalbeit undertaken at great national and personal sacrificewas really an extension of the same processes at work in the country for centuries. Prehistoric Japanese culture was exposed to ancient Chinese cultural influences beginning some two millennia ago. One consequence of these influences was the imposition of the gridiron system of land division, which long endured; it is still possible to trace the ancient place-names and field division lines of this system. Chinese writing and many other Chinese developments were introduced in the early centuries ce; the writing system underwent many modifications over the centuries, since it did not fit the Japanese language. Buddhismwhich originated in India and underwent modification in Central Asia, China, and Korea before reaching Japan about the 6th centuryalso exerted a profound influence on Japanese cultural life, although over the course of time it was modified profoundly from its antecedent forms. Similarly, Chinese urban design was introduced in the layouts of the ancient capital cities of Nara and Kyto but did not proliferate in the archipelago. The Japanization of introduced cultural elements was greatly accelerated during the 250-year period of near-isolation that ended in the mid-19th century. After the Meiji Restoration (1868), Japan began to modernize and to industrialize on the European and American pattern. Western cultural traits were introduced on a large scale through the schools and the mass communication media. Western scientific and technical terms have been widely diffused in translation and have even been reexported to China and Korea. American and European influences on Japanese culture are in evidence in literature, the visual arts, music, education, science, recreation, and ideology. Modernization was accompanied by cultural changes. Rationalism and socialism based on Christianity, as well as Marxism, became inseparably related to everyday Japanese life. Western or Westernized music generally is more common than traditional Japanese music in many social settings. Although Japanese Christians form a tiny percentage of the population, Christmas (or the outer trappings of it) is widely observed, almost as a folk event. The use of Western dress among the Japanese, in place of the traditional kimono, long ago became commonplace, although women may wear formal kimonos at certain celebrations, and both men and women may use casual styles for home wear. House construction also was changed considerably by the introduction of Western architectural forms and functions. In shape, in colour, and in building materials, many contemporary Japanese houses are significantly different from the traditional ones; they now have more modernistic shapes, use more colours, and are more often made of concrete and stucco. Aesthetics interior of a cha-shitsuInterior of a cha-shitsu (tea house).(more)Japanese contemplative gardenRock-and-gravel kare sansui (dry mountain stream) contemplative garden in Japan.(more)The dual influences of East and West have helped construct a modern Japanese culture that offers familiar elements to the Westerner but that also contains a powerful and distinctive traditional cultural aesthetic. This can be seen, for example, in the intricate detail, miniaturization, and concepts of subtlety that have transformed imported visual art forms. This aesthetic is best captured in the Japanese concept of shibui (literally, astringent), or refined understatement in all manner of artistic representation. Closely related are the twin ideals of cultivated simplicity and poverty (wabi) and of the celebration of that which is old and faded (sabi). Underlying all three is the notion of lifes transitory and evanescent nature, which is linked to Buddhist thought (particularly Zen) but can be traced to the earliest examples of Japanese literature. Japanese tidying expert Marie Kondo, whose best-selling books and English-language TV programs have made her a celebrity in the West, incorporates many of these ideals in her KonMari Method of simplifying and uncluttering our lives and living spaces by discarding belongings and relationships that no longer bring joy, calm, and beauty to our fleeting lives.

Participation in the military is optional, and males can enter service at age 17. The Jordanian armed forces include an army and an air force equipped with sophisticated jet aircraft; it developed from the Arab Legion. There is also a small navy that acts as a coast guard. The king is commander in chief of the armed forces. Health and welfare The countrys infant mortality rate is lower than those of several other countries in the region. Most infectious diseases have been brought under control, and the number of physicians per capita has grown rapidly. Comprehensive health facilities are operated by the government, but hospitals are found only in major urban centres. A national health insurance program covers medical, dental, and eye care at a modest cost; service is provided free to the poor. Welfare services were private until the mid-1950s, when the government assumed responsibility. Besides supervising and coordinating social and charitable organizations, the ministry administers welfare programs. Housing The housing situation has remained critical despite continuing construction. Surveys conducted in Amman and the eastern Jordan Valley show that most households live in one-room dwellings. The Housing Corporation and the Jordan Valley Authority build units for low-income families, and urban renewal projects in Amman and Al-Zarq have provided new and renovated units. Housing outside of the cities and major towns remains austere, and a small number of Bedouin still live in their traditional black tents. Education The great majority of the population is literate, and more than half have completed secondary education or higher. Jordan has three types of schoolsgovernment schools, private schools, and the UNRWA schools that have been set up for Palestinian refugee children. Schooling consists of six years of elementary, three years of preparatory, and three years of secondary education. The Ministry of Education supervises all schools and establishes the curricula, teachers qualifications, and state examinations; it also distributes free books to students in government schools and enforces compulsory education to the age of 14. The majority of the students attend government schools. Jordans oldest institutions of higher learning include the University of Jordan (1962), Yarmk University (1976), and Mutah University (1981). Many new universities were established in the 1990s. In addition to Khadduri Agricultural Training Institute, there are agricultural secondary schools as well as a number of vocational, labour, and social affairs institutes, a Sharah legal seminary, and nursing, military, and teachers colleges.Cultural life Daily life and social customs Jordan is an integral part of the Arab world and thus shares a cultural tradition common to the region. The family is of central importance to Jordanian life. Although their numbers have fallen as many have settled and adopted urban culture, the rural Bedouin population still follows a more traditional way of life, preserving customs passed down for generations. Village life revolves around the extended family, agriculture, and hospitality; modernity exists only in the form of a motorized vehicle for transportation. Urban-dwelling Jordanians, on the other hand, enjoy all aspects of modern, popular culture, from theatrical productions and musical concerts to operas and ballet performances. Most major towns have movie theatres that offer both Arab and foreign films. Younger Jordanians frequent Internet cafs in the capital, where espresso is served at computer terminals. The countrys cuisine features dishes using beans, olive oil, yogurt, and garlic. Jordans two most popular dishes are musakhkhan, chicken cooked with sumac and onions and placed over clay-oven flatbread, and mansaf, lamb or mutton and rice with a yogurt sauce, which are both served on holidays and on special family occasions. Daily fare includes khubz (flatbread) with vegetable dips, grilled meats, and stews, served with sweet tea or coffee flavoured with cardamom. Holidays that are celebrated in the kingdom include the Prophet Muhammads birthday (mawlid), the two ds (festivals; Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha), and other major Islamic festivals, along with secular events such as Independence Day and the birthday of the late King Hussein.

Oral epics formed the main literary genre among the largely illiterate Kazakhs until the 19th century. In the 18th century, as a series of Russian outposts arose along the border of Kazakhstans plains on the north, Kazakhs added other written, poetic forms to their literature. Poetry remained the primary genre until prose stories, short novels, and drama were introduced in the early 20th century, before the end of the tsarist era in 1917. Abay Ibrahim Knanbay-ul (Kunanbayev) in the late 19th century laid the basis with his verse for the development of the modern Kazakh literary language and its poetry. (Aqmet) Baytrsyn-ul, editor of the influential newspaper Qazaq, led the advance of modern Kazakh writing in the early 20th century. Baytrsyn-ul, along with Aliqan Nrmuhambet Bokeyqan-ul, Mir Jaqib Duwlat-ul, and, later, Maghjan Jumabay-ul, represented the cream of Kazakh modernism in literature, publishing, and cultural politics in the reformist decades before Sovietization set in after 1920. All these figures disappeared into Soviet prisons and never returned, as a result of Joseph Stalins purges, which destroyed much of the Kazakh intelligentsia. An early Soviet Kazakh writer, Mukhtar Auez-ul, won recognition for the long novel Abay, based on the life and poetry of Knanbay-ul, and for his plays, including nglik-Kebek. Kazakhstan has a number of modern theatres and offers Uighur, Korean, and Russian musicals, opera, ballet, and puppet performances. Cinemas and art schools, dance ensembles, and music groups are active, as are radio and television broadcasting, the last being especially important in communications with distant farms and villages. Reception from outside Kazakhstan, especially from broadcasting stations in nearby Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan and by way of relays from Moscow, enables listeners and viewers to follow programs from many sources. Edward Allworth  History  Kazakhstan to c. 1700 ce The immense size and varied landscape of Kazakhstan exclude the possibility of a unified prehistoric culture covering the whole area. The Bronze Age Andronovo culture (2nd millennium bce) spread over much of Kazakhstan; it was followed by periods dominated by nomads, producers of the animal art later identified with the Scythians. One can only speculate concerning the ethnic or linguistic identities of these populations; whether or not they were Turkic, they cannot be directly linked with the Kazakhs. In the course of centuries, various parts of present-day Kazakhstan were incorporated into different empires. During the empire of the Mongols (13th14th century ce), most of the territory was part of the ulus (polity) of Chagatai. About 1465, under the leadership of Karay and Jani Beg, some 200,000 dissatisfied subjects of the Uzbek khan Abl-Khayr (Ab al-Khayr) moved into Mughulistn, whose khan, Esen Bogha (Buga), settled them between the Chu and Talas rivers. These separatist Uzbeks became known as Kazakh (Independent or Vagabond) Uzbeks, and over time a significant differentiation developed between them and the nonseparatist Uzbeks in their respective ways of life: that of the Kazakhs was more nomadic, that of the Uzbeks more sedentary. During the late 15th century and throughout the 16th century, the Kazakhs were able to consolidate a nomadic empire stretching across the steppes east of the Caspian and north of the Aral Sea as far as the upper Irtysh River and the western approaches to the Altai Mountains. Under Burunduk Khan (ruled 14881509) and Kasym Khan (150918), the Kazakhs were the masters of virtually the entire steppe region, reportedly able to bring 200,000 horsemen into the field and feared by all their neighbours. The prevailing view is that the rule of Kasym Khan marked the beginning of an independent Kazakh polity. Under his rule Kazakh power extended from what is now southeastern Kazakhstan to the Ural Mountains. Under the successive rule of three of the sons of Kasym Khan (151838), however, there was a partial weakening of the khans authority, accompanied by a trend, later to become more pronounced, for the khanate to disintegrate into three separate hordes. These were, from east to west, the Great Horde, in present-day southeastern Kazakhstan north of the Tien Shan; the Middle Horde, in the central steppe region east of the Aral Sea; and the Little Horde, between the Aral Sea and the Ural River. In each horde the authority of the khan tended to be curtailed by the power exercised by tribal chieftains, known as sultans, and perhaps even more by the beys and batyrs (the heads of the clans that were the components of each tribe). Nominally, the khans commanded a formidable force of mounted warriors, but, in reality, they depended on the loyalty of the beys and batyrs. The last son of Kasym Khan to rule the Kazakh steppes, aqq Naar (153880), overcame these obstacles and, having succeeded in reuniting the three hordes, embarked upon systematic raids into Transoxania, a trend that continued under his immediate successors down to the reign of Tevkkel Khan (158698), who even temporarily occupied Samarkand. By the beginning of the 17th century, the fragmentation halted by Kasym Khan resumed and became endemic; Kazakh central power was weak or nonexistent amidst a plethora of petty rulers. From the 1680s to the 1770s the Kazakhs were involved in a series of wars with the Oyrats, a federation of four western Mongol tribes, among which the Dzungars were particularly aggressive. In 168184 the Dzungars, led by Dga-ldan (Galdan), launched a devastating attack against the Great Horde. The unification by Teke Khan (16801718) of the three hordes brought a temporary reversal in the fortunes of war, and in 171112 a Kazakh counteroffensive penetrated deep into Dzungar territory. Tekes achievements were not limited to war; he also was responsible for the creation of a Kazakh law code, an amalgam of Kazakh customary and Islamic laws. In 1723 Dga-ldans successor, Cevang Rabtan, was again on the attack. Aided by Swedish officers who had been Russian prisoners at the Battle of Poltava (1709) and found their way to these distant parts, the Dzungars launched a devastating invasion of the eastern Kazakh lands. The memory of this national catastrophe, the Great Disaster, has never faded among the Kazakhs. The next and last Dzungar invasion hit the Middle Horde, butthanks to the skills of that hordes khan, Ab al-Khayr (171849), who managed to forge a temporary all-Kazakh allianceit was less devastating. The elimination of the Dzungar threat came in the form of Chinese (Manchu) intervention; in 175758 the Qianlong emperor launched two major campaigns, in the course of which the Dzungars were, for all practical purposes, exterminated and their land incorporated into China. For a time, Ablai Khan of the Middle Horde had shrewdly chosen not to take sides in the Dzungar-Chinese conflict. But, once the scores were settled, Ablai found it prudent to offer his submission to the Qianlong emperor. Then, in 1771, Ablai was confirmed as ruler by both the Chinese and the Russians. As a result of the collapse of Dzungar power, the Chinese inherited a vast territory that extended to Lake Balkhash and beyond, far into the Kazakh steppes. The brunt of the Dzungar wars was carried by the Great Horde; the Middle and Little hordes fared better, partly because they moved westward toward Russian-held territories. In 1730 Abl-Khayr, khan of the Little Horde, swore allegiance to the Russian empress Anna.   Russian and Soviet rule The reverses experienced by the Kazakhs at the hands of the Dzungars undoubtedly retarded the emergence of a unified Kazakh state and further depressed the prevailing level of Kazakh cultural life. They also rendered the Kazakhs even less able to resist the encroachments of Russia from the north. The advance onto the Kazakh steppe began with the construction of a line of fortsOmsk in 1716, Semipalatinsk in 1718, Ust-Kamenogorsk in 1719, and Orsk in 1735which was then steadily advanced southward. The Russian advance into Kazakh territory was slow and seldom violent but ineluctable; it made full use of Kazakh internal divisions and dissensions but was, in its essence, the typical encroachment of sedentary agriculturalists into the lands of nomads. Russian occupation of the Kazakh steppe would prove essential for the conquest of Muslim Central Asia. Some Kazakhs believed that the Russian presence might at least provide some security against Dzungar raids, and in 1731 the Little Horde accepted Russian protection, followed by the Middle Horde in 1740 and by part of the Great Horde in 1742, although its effect upon the Dzungars was to prove minimal. Finally, after a series of ineffectual Kazakh uprisings of which the most extensive was that of Batyr Srym in 179297, Russia resolved to suppress such autonomy as the Kazakh khans still possessed. In 1822 the khanate of the Middle Horde was abolished, in 1824 the Little Horde, and in 1848 the Great Horde. Because of Kazakhstans incorporation into Russia, modern ideas found a more fertile ground among the Kazakhs than in the semi-independent Uzbek khanates. Russian schooling brought these ideas into Kazakh life, and Russian-formed intellectuals such as Chokan Valikanov and Abay Knanbay-ul adapted them to specific Kazakh needs and created a secular culture unparalleled in other parts of Asian Russia. The Kazakhs were onlookers rather than participants in the Russian Civil War that followed the fall of the tsarist regime in 1917. A Kazakh provisional government formed by the ephemeral Alash Orda political party existed only in name. In 191920 the Bolsheviks Red Army defeated White Russian forces in the region and occupied Kazakhstan. On August 26, 1920, the Soviet government established the Kirgiz Autonomous Republic, which in 1925 changed its name to the Kazakh A.S.S.R. From 1927 the Soviet government pursued a vigorous policy of transforming the Kazakh nomads into a settled population and of colonizing the region with Russians and Ukrainians. Despite their nomadic rural existence, the Kazakhs were the most literate and dynamic indigenous people in Central Asia. But the collectivization brutally imposed by the Soviet regime resulted in a shocking decrease in the Kazakh population: between 1926 and 1939 the number of Kazakhs in the Soviet Union fell by about one-fifth. More than 1.5 million died during this period, the majority from starvation and related diseases, others as a result of violence. Thousands of Kazakhs fled to China, but fewer than one-fourth survived the journey; about 300,000 fled to Uzbekistan and 44,000 to Turkmenistan. Kazakhstan formally became a constituent (union) republic of the Soviet Union on December 5, 1936. During the first secretaryship of Nikita Khrushchev, the role of Kazakhstan within the Soviet Union increased dramatically. The Virgin and Idle Lands program launched in 1953 opened up the vast grasslands of northern Kazakhstan to wheat farming by Slavic settlers, a program that, over the course of several decades, led to an ecological disaster (see Aral Sea). Kazakhstans significance in the Soviet period also increased through the location on its territory of the main Soviet space-launch centre and a substantial part of the Soviet Unions nuclear weaponry and the sites associated with nuclear testing. For a quarter of a century Kazakh politics were dominated by Dinmukhamed Kunayev, first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan from 1959 to 1986. The only Kazakh ever to become a member of the Soviet Politburo, Kunayev proved to be a masterful Soviet politician. Realizing that Kazakhs constituted a minority of Kazakhstans population, he looked with equal care after the needs of both Russians and Kazakhs. His dismissal in 1986 by the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev caused the first serious riots of the 1980s in the Soviet Union.  "},{"CountryName":"Kenya","CulturalInfo":" Education of KenyaThe national educational system consists of three levels: eight years of compulsory primary education (beginning at age six), four years at the secondary level, and four years of higher education. The government provides free primary and secondary education. Entrance into secondary school is contingent upon obtaining the Kenyan Certificate of Primary Education by passing a national exam. Education for the indigenous population was not a priority of the British colonial government. After independence, however, primary and secondary school enrollment expanded markedly. Jomo Kenyatta, Kenyas first president, promised free primary education to all citizens in 1963, a promise only partially fulfilled when fees for the first four years of primary school were abolished in 1974. One consequence of this educational expansion was that underemployment and unemployment increased as better-educated citizens entered the job market. The government responded by expanding the civil service beginning in the late 1970s, but by the early 1990s it could no longer absorb this population. The problem was compounded as the number of secondary schools grew. Because the government could not provide enough government-funded schools, community-built harambee secondary schools were developed. These schools were supposed to receive government assistance to provide for teachers and learning materials, but such support did not always materialize. The government simultaneously pursued a policy of education for self-reliance, whereby education was oriented toward preparing students for employment in agriculture as well as in business. Universal free education was introduced for all years of primary schooling in 2002. In the following years, primary schools were not able to accommodate the increased demand for services and faced such problems as overcrowding and a lack of resources. Education is still highly valued in Kenya, with many of the students pursuing strategies such as shadow education (after-school and weekend tutoring) and remaining in a grade more than one year in order to pass the Certificate of Primary Education exam. Because of the countrys continuing economic problems, however, many of these students have not been able to attend school beyond the primary level; free secondary schooling was introduced in 2008 to help address this issue. Kenyas literacy rate, at more than four-fifths of the population, is high for sub-Saharan Africa. Public universities include the University of Nairobi (1956) and Kenyatta University (1972) in Nairobi, Moi University (1984) in Eldoret, and Egerton University (1939) in Njoro, as well as the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (1981) in Nairobi. Specialized colleges include Kenya Conservatoire of Music (1944), Kenya Medical Training College (1924), and Kenya Polytechnic (1961) in Nairobi and Rift Valley Institute of Science and Technology (1972) in Nakuru.   Cultural life  Daily life and social customs As is true of many developing African countries, there is a marked contrast between urban and rural culture in Kenya. Attracting people from all over the country, Kenyas cities are characterized by a more cosmopolitan population whose tastes reflect practices that combine the local with the global. Nairobis nightlife, for instance, caters to youth interested in music that varies from American rhythm and blues, hip-hop, and rock to Congolese rumba. The city contains movie theatres and numerous nightclubs where patrons can dance or shoot pool; for children there are water parks and family amusement centres. For all the modernization and urbanization of Kenya, however, traditional practices remain important. Rituals and customs are very well documented, owing to the intense anthropological study of Kenyas peoples during the period of British colonial rule; oral literature is safeguarded, and several publishing houses publish traditional folktales and ethnographies. Kenyan cooking reflects British, Arab, and Indian influences. Foods common throughout Kenya include ugali, a mush made from corn (maize) and often served with such greens as spinach and kale. Chapati, a fried pitalike bread of Indian origin, is served with vegetables and stew; rice is also popular. Seafood and freshwater fish are eaten in most parts of the country and provide an important source of protein. Many vegetable stews are flavoured with coconut, spices, and chilies. Although meat traditionally is not eaten every day or is eaten only in small quantities, grilled meat and all-you-can-eat buffets specializing in game, or bush meat, are popular. Many people utilize shambas (vegetable gardens) to supplement purchased foods. In areas inhabited by the Kikuyu, irio, a stew of peas, corn, and potatoes, is common. The Maasai, known for their herds of livestock, avoid killing their cows and instead prefer to use products yielded by the animal while it is alive, including blood drained from nonlethal wounds. They generally drink milk, often mixed with cows blood, and eat the meat of sheep or goats rather than cows. Urban life in Kenya is by no means uniform. For example, as a Muslim town, Mombasa stands in contrast to Nairobi. Although there are numerous restaurants, bars, and clubs in Mombasa, there are also many mosques, and women dressed in bui buis (loose-fitting garments that cover married Muslim women from head to toe) are common. Rural life is oriented in two directionstoward the lifestyles of rural inhabitants, who still constitute the majority of Kenyas population, and toward foreign tourists who come to visit the many national parks and reserves. Although agricultural duties occupy most of the time of rural dwellers, they still find occasion to visit markets and shopping centres, where some frequent beer halls. Mobile cinemas also provide entertainment for the rural population. Kenya observes most Christian holidays, as well as the Muslim festival Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan. Jamhuri, or Independence Day, is celebrated on December 12. Moi Day (recognizing Daniel arap Moi) and Kenyatta Day, both in October, honour two of the countrys presidents, while Madaraka (Swahili: Government) Day (June 1) celebrates Kenyas attainment of self-governance in 1964.   The arts The Kenya National Theatre, a part of the Kenya Cultural Centre, is the countrys premier venue for drama. The affiliated National Theatre School (founded 1968) provides professional training for Kenyan playwrights and performers of traditional music and dance. Independent art facilities, such as the GoDown Arts Centre in Nairobi, offer alternative spaces for artists to express themselves. Kenyas pop music is among the most varied in Africa, drawing on diverse sources, including African rumba, traditional Indian musical forms, and a wide range of European and American styles. Popular since the 1960s is an indigenous pop style that emerged in the area around Lake Victoria inhabited by the Luo; called benga, it is perhaps the most distinctly Kenyan form in the musical repertoire. Taarab, a popular music of the eastern coastal region heavily influenced by Arabic styles, is also played throughout the country. Kenyan literature includes a large body of oral and written folklore, much of the latter collected by British anthropologists. During the colonial era, writers of European origin residing in Kenya, such as Elspeth Huxley (The Flame Trees of Thika, 1959) and Isak Dinesen (Out of Africa, 1937), introduced indigenous themes and settings to broad audiences. The Swahili literary tradition (see also Swahili literature), both oral and written, dates to the 18th century and is represented by authors such as Muyaka bin Haji al-Ghassaniy and Kupona Mwana. Contemporary novelists, including Ngugi wa Thiongo, Grace Ogot, Meja Mwangi, Hilary Ngweno, Margaret Ogola, and R. Mugo Gatheru, address problems in colonial and postcolonial society. Many of these writers publish in English, although Thiongo has insisted on publishing first in his native Kikuyu, saying:  Only by a return to the roots of our being in the languages and cultures and heroic histories of the Kenyan people can we rise up to the challenge of helping in the creation of a Kenyan patriotic national literature and culture that will be the envy of many foreigners and the pride of Kenyans.  Visual arts are largely confined to the mass production of wood sculpture and Maasai beadwork. Elimo Njau, Etale Sukuro, and Kivuthi Mbuno are noted Kenyan artists employing a variety of mediums. The countrys film industry is small but growing, though viewings of indigenous films are usually confined to theatres in the cities; in smaller towns and villages, film fare is likely to come from either Hollywood or India. Many foreign productions have been filmed in Kenyasuch as Out of Africa (1985), To Walk with Lions (1999), Nowhere in Africa (2001), and The Constant Gardener (2005)owing to its scenic, varied landscapes and generally clement weather.  "},{"CountryName":"Kiribati","CulturalInfo":"Markers not found in Cultural life section"},{"CountryName":"Kosovo","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life The cultural lives of Kosovos Albanians and Serbs, although distinctive, bear many resemblances to those of the peoples of Albania and Serbia, respectively. For further information on the cultures of those countries, see Albania: Cultural life and Serbia: Cultural life. Cultural milieu Traditional Kosovar society, for both Albanians and Serbs, has an important patriarchal tradition, with extended family members often living together in large groups. Family support networks remain very strong, even when some members live outside the country. Most business connections are made through these networks. Reflecting Albanian customary law, blood feuds between families were a fairly common occurrenceespecially in western Kosovountil the 1990s, when University of Pristina professor Anton etta and other activists led an antivendetta campaign. The practice resurfaced, however, amid the political instability following the 199899 conflict. Daily life and social customs In Kosovos largely secular society, most people dress in Western clothing. Although Muslim women and girls generally do not wear head scarves, in 2009 the ministry of education banned them from schools, arousing controversy. Many older Albanian men still wear a traditional brimless white cap, or plis. For weddings, full traditional dress often is worn, particularly by women; these garments may be embroidered with silver. Among the most popular traditional Albanian dishes are fli, a dish of pancakelike pastry layered with cream and yogurt, and pite, a phyllo pastry with cheese, meat, or vegetable filling. A distinctive dish is llokuma (sometimes translated as wedding doughnuts), deep-fried dough puffs eaten with yogurt and garlic or with honey. Baklava is the most common sweet to serve for special occasions. Many of Kosovos seasonal rites originated in pagan times, and some later were integrated with the Christian and Islamic faiths. For instance, both Orthodox Christians and Muslims burn a Yule log about the time of the winter solstice. For Orthodox Christians, it is a Christmas Eve tradition (celebrated on January 6, according to the Orthodox liturgical calendar). For Muslims the log is known as the buzm. In the Orthodox community, Christmas is surpassed in significance by Easter. Among Muslims, Ramadan is the most important celebration. A popular springtime holiday, St. Georges Day (Albanian: Shngjergji), is celebrated by members of all faiths. In fall, Kosovar Albanians observe Thanksgiving Day (Darka e Lams). The arts Heroic epics and ballads as well as oral prose traditionally played an important part in relaying the history and myths associated with the ethnic groups of Kosovo. Recitation often was accompanied by the sounds of traditional instrumentssuch as the single-stringed gusla (Albanian: lahuta; Serbian: gusle) or, among Albanians, the larger two-stringed ifteli. These stories and songs remain important underpinnings of ethnic identity for both Albanians and Serbs. Traditional dances, often circle dances, are still performed as well, often by single-sex groups. One of the earliest examples of art identified within Kosovo is a 6,000-year-old small terra-cotta figure known as the Goddess on the Throne. Discovered near Pristina in the mid-20th century, it serves as a symbol of Kosovo. Kosovo is rich in folk art dating from the more recent past as well. Snake symbols are a common feature of Albanian architecture and decoration, and a pagan belief that snakes protect households survives to the present day. One of the best-known Kosovar artists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries is Sokol Beqiri, whose works include provocative photography, video, and performance pieces. In the late 19th century, especially after the founding of the Albanian League (the first Albanian nationalist organization; also called the League of Prizren) in 1878, a number of Albanian literary figures advocated for independence from the Ottoman Empire. However, there was relatively little written literature in the Albanian language until the 20th century. Albanian literature in Kosovo proceeded to develop differently than it did in Albania, where the communist government imposed more severe ideological constraints. Among the best-known Kosovar Albanian writers of the 20th and 21st centuries are the novelist, playwright, and poet Eqrem Basha; the poet and critic Sabri Hamiti; the poet Ali Podrimja; the scholar, novelist, and political figure Rexhep Qosja; the novelist Zejnullah Rrahmani; the poet Azem Shkreli; and the poet, doctor, and political activist Flora Brovina, who gained renown during her imprisonment by Yugoslav authorities in 19992000. Among Kosovar Serb writers, the 20th-century novelist and literary critic Vukain Filipovi was respected by the Albanian and Serb communities alike. In the years following the 199899 conflict, Kosovos young population helped to revive the arts scene. Pristina in particular became a vibrant centre for art, drama, and music. Folk, classical, and contemporary popular music thrived. Cultural institutions Graanica MonasteryGraanica (Graanica) Monastery, completed c. 1321, Kosovo.(more)Among Kosovos most significant historic sites are the medieval Serbian Orthodox monasteries of Deani (Albanian: Dean), Graanica (Graanica; near Pristina), and Pe (Pej), as well as the Church of the Virgin of Ljevia (near Prizren). In 2004 the Deani monastery was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site; the others were inscribed in 2006. Two of the oldest Muslim sites are the 15th-century arshia and Mbretit (Fatih) mosques in Pristina. During the 199899 conflict, dozens of Muslim sites were destroyed, including the 18th-century Red Mosque in Pej and the Ottoman-era bazaar in Gjakov (akovica). Following the conflict, revenge attacks damaged or destroyed a number of Orthodox churches, although the World Heritage sites survived. Pristina: Kosovo MuseumKosovo Museum, Pristina, Kosovo.(more)Pristina is home to the Kosovo Museum (2002), the Academy of Sciences and Arts (1975), and the National Theatre (1946; originally located in Prizren). Construction of an opera house, named after the pre-independence Kosovar Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, began in the capital in 2009. Many of Kosovos cultural and archaeological artifacts remain in Belgrade, Serb., where they were taken prior to the 199899 conflict. Sports and recreation Skiing, football (soccer), basketball, wrestling, table tennis, and judo are among the sports popular in Kosovo. However, because Kosovos independence was not universally recognized, the International Olympic Committee and a number of other international sports organizations denied Kosovar applications for membership. In the early 21st century, ski resorts were under repair following years of neglect and war damage. Kosovo created a network of protected natural areas, including Sharr Mountains National Park, located along the border with North Macedonia. Media and publishing Freedom of the press was enshrined in the 2008 constitution. The publicly funded broadcaster Radio Television Kosovo provides television and radio programming, primarily in the Albanian language. There are also a number of privately owned television and radio broadcasters. The major newspaper is the Albanian-language Koha Ditore (The Daily Times); other Albanian publications include Zri (The Voice), Kosova Sot (Kosovo Today), and Epoka e Re (The New Epoch). The Serb community relies on Serbian-language media from local outlets as well as from Serbia.Antonia Young "},{"CountryName":"Kuwait","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life market in Kuwait CityPeople shop at a souk or market in Kuwait City in Kuwait.(more)Although Kuwait embraces many facets of Western culture, the country remains culturally conservative. Its Arab-Islamic heritage permeates daily life. As in much of the Middle East, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the 1970s and 80s was reflected in a general return to traditional customs, as seen in the public dress of women, who began wearing the hijab, or veil, far more than in the past. The right of women to drive automobiles and to work outside the home is generally accepted and has not been a matter of public debate, yet the question of granting women the right to vote has divided Islamists, some of whom seek to enforce even more conservative Islamic standards such as those found in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.  Daily life and social customs At the heart of traditional Kuwaiti culture is the institution of the diwniyyah, a regular gathering of menusually in a tent or a separate room of the main housewhich serves as a time to gather, enjoy refreshments, talk, or play games. Kuwaitis observe all major Islamic holidays, including Ramadan and the two ds (festivals), Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. The countrys Independence Day and Liberation Day (from the Iraqi occupation of 199091) are important secular holidays. falafelFl, falafel, and hummus are the cornerstones of Kuwaiti cuisine, though Western fast-food restaurants abound in Kuwait city. Fl is a paste based on fava beans, with garlic and lemon added. Formed from fried balls of chickpeas and spices, falafel is often served in unleavened bread (khubz) with vegetables. Chickpeas are also used to make hummus, a dip for vegetables and bread. The traditional Kuwaiti meal consists of spiced rice topped with meat or fish or shellfish taken from the Persian Gulf.   The arts Kuwaiti folk arts remain important, and Bedouin crafts are the most prominent. Though few Bedouins now inhabit Kuwait, their art traditions, especially weaving, have been maintained. The intricately woven fabrics are made on a sadu, a Bedouin loom, and are common sights in souks (bazaars). Sadu House, a museum for Bedouin crafts, offers classes on weaving. Also popular are traditional dances, including the arah, which features swords and poetry singing. The government supports the preservation of folk arts and funds numerous organizations, as well as several troupes that perform across the country.   Cultural institutions Kuwait has numerous museums, but the Iraqi invasion had a disastrous effect on many institutions. Many artworks were stolen by the Iraqis, and some buildings were severely damaged. The National Museum of Kuwait, which once housed a comprehensive collection of Islamic art, was looted and set ablaze; only a small portion of the building has been renovated and reopened to the public. The loss increased the importance of the Tareq Rajab Museum (Mataf riq), a private collection that features paintings, pottery, metalwork, jewelry, and musical instruments, among other items. The Seif Palacewhich was built in 1910 and later underwent numerous renovations and repairsis one of the ruling familys official residences and is a popular tourist attraction noted for its Islamic architecture.   Sports and recreation Kuwaits sports culture, like that of other gulf states, combines the traditional sports of nomadic Arabian society with contemporary sports of Western origin. Traditional sports of enduring popularity include camel and horse racing; Arabian horses are held to be among the finest in the world. Falconry is enjoyed primarily by wealthy sheikhs, although the overhunting of game and, after 1990, the presence of unexploded land mines in the desert have reduced its practice. Kuwaitis have competed at the national and international levels in the countrys two most widely played sports, football (soccer) and golf. Oil revenues have enabled the government to support sports generously, and the country boasts a number of stadiums capable of hosting international competitions. The country first participated in the 1968 Summer Olympic Games, but it has never competed at the Winter Games.   Media and publishing The Ministry of Information runs the government press and the radio and television broadcasting stations. Much of the print media receives financial support from the government. Although the constitution guarantees freedom of the press, this right has often been suspended. In 1992 print restrictions were relaxed on the condition that the media sources monitor themselves. Direct criticism of the emir, however, is still prohibited.

Communicable diseases (e.g., influenza), cardiovascular diseases, injuries, accidents, violence, cancers, and respiratory diseases are the major health problems and causes of death. The departure of most of the countrys physicians after 1975 created a serious problem for the new government. In response, the government began to build village infirmaries and dispensaries in most of the provinces and to train medical workers. These village medical workers, often using only traditional medicinal herbs, have continued to provide much of the countrys primary health care.\nEducation\nIn the past the teaching of much cultural lore and reading and writing took place in Buddhist temples and was available only to men. The French introduced European-style education in the early 20th century, and over the next several decades the number of elementary school students reached hundreds of thousands. The LPDR government assumed responsibility for education in 1975 and inaugurated a program to bring primary education to all areas of Laos within a decade. The new regime also launched a major adult literacy campaign in the mid-1980s. Although literacy has increased considerably since that time, it has been difficult to maintain in rural areas where there is limited reading material.\nDuring the early years of the LPDR, the governments primary concern in education was a political one, with the dissemination of knowledge of the partys policies being the main aim of the new Laotian curriculum. Reassessment of the curriculum began in the 1980s following the collapse of communist regimes in eastern Europe and the return to Laos of young people who had been sent to those countries for higher education. Textbooks were revised to downplay ideological rhetoric and to increase the relevance of their content to the socioeconomic realities of contemporary Laos. A new curriculum came into operation throughout Laos in 1996.\nSince the late 20th century, the educational system of Laos has continued to struggle with underfunding, inadequate teacher training, and insufficient facilities. Nevertheless, the literacy rate has risen substantially, and the number of primary and secondary schools, teachers, and students has increased dramatically. The National University of Laos in Vientiane was established in 1995 through the consolidation of several tertiary institutions and a centre for agriculture; this supplanted the royal governments former university, which had been disbanded by the communist regime.\nHigher education in Laos went through a major overhaul in 2013. The Ministry of Education and Sports decided to no longer allow private tertiary institutions to confer bachelors and masters degrees. Henceforth, such degrees could be granted only by the five state universities: the National University of Laos, the University of Health Sciences (also in Vientiane), Souphanouvong University in Luang Prabang, Savannakhet University, and Champasak University. The ministry aimed to improve the quality of higher education by placing the sector entirely under the responsibility of public universities and to require private institutions to support professional and technical training.\nCultural life\nCultural milieu\nAmong the lowland Lao, traditions of Buddhism and the boun (festival)historically associated with village life but now also practiced in urban areasguide everyday life. The merit-making ritual of giving alms to monks during their morning rounds, once discouraged by the government, has remained a prominent practice.\nAmong the upland peoples, traditional rituals also persist, although some groups, such as the Hmong, do not feel the same attachment to the village as a spatial or social unit that the lowland Lao do. To the Hmong the primary foci of social identification are the household, the group of close relatives, and the clan, irrespective of any temporary or even permanent settlement. The Hmong cosmos is inhabited by a wide array of spirits, including medicine spirits, nature spirits, and shamanic spirits. Both social and spiritual life, then, vary markedly between the lowland and highland regions of Laos.\n"},{"CountryName":"Latvia","CulturalInfo":" Political process Suffrage is universal for all Latvian citizens aged 18 and older. However, as part of the governments attempts to preserve and increase the dominance of Latvian culture in the face of the countrys large non-ethnic Latvian population, those wishing to become citizens are required to pass a Latvian language test. Until the late 1980s, when several prodemocracy groups united as the Popular Front of Latvia, the Communist Party of Latvia (Latvijas Komunistu Partija; LKP), like its counterparts in the other republics of the Soviet Union, was the only source of political power, under the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The party was dominated by non-Latvians (mainly Russians and other Slavs) and by Russified Latvians who had lived in Russia for large parts of their lives. The power of the Communist Party began to weaken by the late 1980s, and in 1990 Latvia adopted a multiparty system. The Communist Party was outlawed in 1991, and many new and revived parties developed under the Popular Front. The legacy of the LKP was widespread distrust of large-scale centralized political parties. Thus, the political landscape in Latvia after independence was complex. The Latvian National Independence Movement, founded in 1988, garnered a measure of popular support, but there were many other parties similarly intent on broadening their membership. Parties espousing liberal philosophies, environmental principles, or particular interests, such as those of the growing number of private farmers, were part of the fast-changing political scene.   Education General literacy was achieved in Latvia in the 1890s. Education is free and compulsory until age 16. A 1998 education law ensured that a certain amount of instruction be provided in the Latvian language in the countrys minority schools. However, state financing is provided for minority schools that teach classes in Belarusian, Estonian, Hebrew, Lithuanian, Polish, Romany, Russian, and Ukrainian, to preserve each minoritys heritage and culture. Notable institutions of higher learning include the University of Latvia (1919), the Latvia University of Agriculture (1939), and Riga Technical University (1990). The Stockholm School of Economics in Riga opened in 1994. The Latvian Academy of Sciences (1946) in Riga is one of the top research institutes in the country.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Because it has been invaded and occupied by neighbouring powers for much of its history, Latvia has had to struggle to preserve its distinctive language, folklore, and customs. The countrys loss of political independence in the 13th century effectively halted the development of Latvian culture for centuries. Indeed, it is only since the end of the 19th century that Latvians have been able to openly and actively celebrate their cultural heritage.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tBritannica Quiz\t\tThe Country Quiz\t\n   Daily life and social customs Religious and folkloric festivals, which were banned under Soviet rule, are celebrated again in traditional style. The festivals, complete with dance, music, and song, are usually performed in colourful costumes that are typical of specific regions of the country. The most important annual festival is Ji, a midsummer tradition based on an ancient pagan ceremony that celebrates the summer solstice. It is considered bad luck to fall asleep before dawn during Ji. Huge bonfires are lit, and special foods and beverages are prepared. Staples of Latvian cuisine include imeu siers (caraway cheese), bacon, berries, potatoes, sausages, soups, and rye bread. Smoked or salted herring is also a common dish. Berry pies and tarts served with sour cream are favourite desserts.   The arts LatviaA\nmonument\nin Riga, Latvia,\nhonors\nthe Latvian poet and dramatist Rainis (Jnis\nPliekns).(more)The Latvian folk song, or daina, is undoubtedly the heart of Latvian culture. Dainas, which are generally no more than four lines long, tend to be stories of family or love or are related to myths. Andrejs Pumpurss literary epic Lacplesis (1888; Bearslayer) was inspired by the genre, as was the work of Rainis (pseudonym of Jnis Pliekns; 18651929), who is considered one of the great Latvian poets. During the onset of the countrys national cultural awakening in the mid-19th century, Latvians established their artistic independence, and for the first time an artists community formed in Riga. An eminent poet of this period was Mikus Krogzemis, who took the pseudonym Auseklis, a god in Latvian mythology. Some of the best-known Latvian painters of that time were Janis Rozentls and Vilhelms Purvtis, while Andrejs Jurjns and Jazeps Vtols were highly regarded symphonic composers of the era.   Cultural institutions Most of Latvias major cultural sites are in the capital city of Riga. The Latvian National Symphony Orchestra (1926) and the Latvian National Opera are internationally renowned. The Riga Latvian Theatre was established in 1868, during the so-called Neo-Latvian movement of the 1860s and 70s, when Latvians strove to promote their identity in industry, trade, and the arts. Latvian ballet became prominent in the early 20th century, and the Latvian state ballet opened in 1932 in Riga; among its students were Mikhail Baryshnikov and Alexander Godunov. The Latvian Open-Air Ethnographical Museum (1924) is one of the oldest open-air museums in Europe. It includes reproductions of typical 18th-century peasant dwellings, and artisans of all types produce and display their crafts there. The Castle Museum of Bauska, in southern Latvia near the Lithuanian border, is housed in the fortress built in 1443 by the Order of the Brothers of the Sword.   Sports and recreation Gauja National ParkMedieval castle of Turaida in Gauja National Park, Latvia.(more)Latvias climate is conducive to winter sports, and bobsledding, skiing, ice skating, and ice hockey are popular. The Gauja valley is a well-known locale for winter sports. Canoeing on the Gauja and Abava rivers and the lakes in the Latgale region is a national pastime, as is bird-watching in the countryside. Latvias Baltic coast is the site of numerous resorts, and its beaches are popular holiday destinations for tourists from across Europe. Latvia made its first Olympic appearance at the 1924 Winter Games in Chamonix, France. After World War II, Latvian athletes competed for the Soviet Olympic team. Latvia competed at the 1992 Olympics as an independent country for the first time since 1936.   Media and publishing Prior to independence, the media were state-owned and controlled by the Communist Party, mainly through state censors. Media censorship was abolished in 1989, and much of the media flourished as the economy became more liberalized. Latvias print media is divided into Latvian- and Russian-language media. The daily Diena (Day), launched in 1990, is published in Latvian. The Latvian Telegraph Agency (Latvijas Telegrfa Aentra; LETA) is the national news agency. The countrys radio and television outlets mainly air programs in Latvian, Russian, and English; however, according to a 1998 law, at least half of the programming must be of European origin and at least two-fifths must be broadcast in the Latvian language.

As in the field of social welfare, nongovernmental voluntary associationsmostly religious, communal, or ethnicare active. The Lebanese diet is generally satisfactory, and the high standard of living and the favourable climate have served to reduce the incidence of many diseases that are still common in other Middle Eastern countries. Lebanon has a large number of skilled medical personnel, and hospital facilities are adequate under normal circumstances. Following the destruction of the civil war, considerable effortslargely on the part of Lebanons religious communities and nonprofit sectorwere made to upgrade the infrastructure and services in the health and social welfare sectors. The National Social Security Fund, which is not fully implemented, provides sickness and maternity insurance, labour-accident and occupational-disease insurance, family benefits, and termination-of-service benefits.   Housing Lebanon lacks public housing and any plans to build it. In response to the need for low-cost housing, the Popular Housing Law was enacted in the 1960s, providing for the rehabilitation of substandard housing. Prior to the civil war a substantial percentage of homes were without bathrooms, and thousands of families, including Palestinian refugees, were living in improvised accommodations. When an economic boom attracted villagers to the capital, the housing shortage worsened considerably. The civil war drastically increased the problem. Thousands of homes in battle zones were destroyed, and entire villages were evacuated and others occupied. The result was chaos in which property rights were violated as a matter of course. The government, in an attempt to remedy the situation, set up a Housing Bank to make housing loans and subsidies but has remained reluctant to regulate the lucrative real estate market that favours high-end housing unaffordable to most of the population. The influx of refugees from Syria in the 2010s placed further strain on the housing sector.   Education Lebanons well-developed system of education reaches all levels of the population, and literacy rates are among the highest in the Middle East. Although education was once almost exclusively the responsibility of religious communities or foreign groups, public schools have sprung up across the country. Nevertheless, the majority of Lebanese students continue to be educated at private schools, which are generally considered more favourably than their public counterparts. Although more than two-fifths of students were enrolled in public schools in the early 1970s, at the end of the civil war the number had dropped to about one-third. The six-year primary school program is followed by up to six years of either a secondary program (leading to the official baccalaureate certificate) or a program of technical or vocational training (leading to a professional or technical baccalaureate certificate). Major universities include the American University of Beirut (1866), the Universit Saint-Joseph (1875; subsidized by the French government and administered by the Jesuit order), the Lebanese University (Universit Libanaise; 1951), and the Beirut Arab University (1960; an affiliate of the University of Alexandria).   Social and economic division Lebanese society was able for a long time to give a semblance of relative economic stability. The existence of a large middle-income group, in addition to the political and social legitimacy of kinship ties and religious and communal attachments, reinforced the veneer that masked the growing socioeconomic dislocations. The interaction of these factors covered up the growing class polarization, especially around the industrial belt that encircled Beirut. The eruption of civil conflict in 1975, and the state of chaos that ensued, is attributable in part to the fact that the system of government was unresponsive to the acute social problems and grievances. The problems of increasing socioeconomic disparity and government inaction continued into Lebanons post-civil war period. Despite the visible success of some aspects of Lebanons reconstruction program, the reality of the countrys postwar economic situation has been characterized by a dwindling middle class and the descent of many Lebanese citizens into poverty.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Historically, Lebanon is heir to a long succession of Mediterranean culturesPhoenician, Greek, and Arab. Its cultural milieu continues to show clear manifestations of a rich and diverse heritage. As an Arab country, Lebanon shares more than a common language with neighbouring Arab states: it also has a similar cultural heritage and common interests. Anjar, Lebanon: ruinsRuins at Anjar, Lebanon.(more)A number of Lebanons rich cultural sites have been designated UNESCO World Heritage sites: the remains of the city of Anjar (founded by al-Wald in the early 8th century); the ruins of successive cultures at the old Phoenician cities of Baalbek, Byblos, and Tyre; and the Christian monasteries in Wadi Qdsh, together with the nearby remains of a sacred forest of long-prized cedar.   Daily life and social customs Lebanons diverse culture is a result of its admixture of various religious, linguistic, and socioeconomic groups. Family and kinship play a central role in Lebanese social relationships, in both the private and public spheres. Although family structure is traditionally largely patriarchal, women are active in education and politics. hummusBowl of hummus with cucumbers.(more)Lebanese cuisine is characterized by a healthy mixture of herbs and vegetables, fruit, olives, olive oil, laban (yogurt), rice, and khubz (flatbread). Meals often consist of a selection of shared dishes presented all at once on several small plates, often including hummus, stuffed grape leaves, pickled vegetables, grilled meats, and tabbouleh (tabblah), a salad made from herbs, tomato, onion, bulgur wheat, lemon juice, and olive oil. Kibbah, an oval ball of seasoned meat stuffed into a dough made from bulgur and meat, is often considered the national dish. Because of the countrys diverse religious makeup, Lebanese citizens observe a variety of holidays. Those celebrated by the Christian community include Easter and Christmas, the dates of which vary, as elsewhere, between the Catholic and Orthodox communities. Eid al-Fitr (which marks the end of Ramadan), Eid al-Adha (which marks the culmination of the hajj), and the Prophet Muhammads birthday are celebrated by Lebanese Muslims; shr, a holiday particular to Shii Muslims, is also observed. In addition, there are several national holidays, including Liberation Day on May 25 and Independence Day on November 22.  "},{"CountryName":"Lesotho","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life The Sotho combine modern and traditional ways, providing continuity in a society that is disrupted by a system of migratory labour. Although undermined by political developments since independence in 1966, traditional authority is still exercised through a system of chieftaincy, extending from the king through the chiefs to the village level. The chiefs are largely responsible for the working and distribution of land, although in certain areas this authority has been curtailed by the Land Act of 1979. The contradictions created by Lesothos lack of economic independence in the face of political independence are reflected in the cultural life of the country. Despite increasing urbanization and the growth of modern institutions and bureaucracy, many Sotho are still interested in building a rural homestead and perpetuating traditional institutions. They also remain loyal to the chieftaincy system. Institutions such as the initiation schools, which perpetuate traditional values, are still significant but are changing in structure.  Daily life and social customs Urban life is a blend of traditional and Western culture. In Maseru there are shops and markets that offer regional crafts and goods, as well as modern and Western hotels, restaurants, and nightclubs. Many buildings, however, were burned or damaged by looting following the general election of 1998. The city also contains urban villages where tourists can experience traditional life in Lesotho. Village life centres largely on the fields, the chiefs court, the kraals, the school, the church, and the initiation lodge. Circumcision forms an integral part of the ritualized initiation ceremonies that train boys to take their place as full members of the family, clan, and nationthe three centres of social cohesion. Many young boys spend a large part of their lives as herdsmen, while women and young girls do much of the hard work in the fields. Because of the sharp variations in climate, both men and women wear blankets, often multicoloured, which they use as cloaks. Men and women also wear the typical Sotho hat, which is woven from reeds into conical shapes and has a decorative topknot. Sotho dancersSotho dancers entertaining a crowd at a political event in Maseru, Lesotho.(more)Village life is dominated by basic agricultural tasks, with heavy responsibilities falling on women. Craftwork is still practiced in the villages and includes pottery, grass weaving (notably of traditional Sotho hats), and the painting of elaborate decorations on the walls of houses. Herders play a traditional musical instrument called the lesiba, a stringed and wind instrument consisting of a string and feather on which the musician blows. Dances such as the gum boot dance demonstrate the influence of migrant labour on traditional forms of cultural expression. The more traditional mohobelo is a mens stomping dance that consists of synchronized movements and high kicks. Women perform their own dance by kneeling in a line and beating the ground with their knees. Lesotho observes most Christian holidays, including Christmas and Easter. The country also celebrates such secular holidays as Moshoeshoes Day on March 11 (in honour of Moshoeshoe I, the founder of the Sotho nation), Workers Day on May 1 (see May Day), Heroes Day and Africa Day on May 25, Independence Day on October 4 (commemorating the day on which the country received its independence from Britain), Boxing Day on December 26, and Kings Birthday, which is celebrated annually on whichever day the reigning kings birthday falls. The Morija Arts and Cultural Festival is held annually at Morija, south of Maseru, and provides a showcase for Lesothos various artists, performers, and cultural groups.   The arts The work of Lesothos artists is prized by collectors. Many artists are active in the country, and the sale of their work is an important part of Lesothos economy. Many use motifs borrowed from the ancient petroglyphs left by the San people at Ha Baroana, a rock shelter east of Maseru. Contemporary artists include Mathabo Nthako, a female potter who uses traditional African firing techniques to create objects with themes that are religious and filled with subtle humour. Tsepiso Lesenyeho, a painter whose work often depicts village scenes, has earned a following among the Sotho as well as among visitors to the country. The Sotho culture enjoys a rich tradition of oral literature that is given expression in folk songs, proverbs, jokes, myths, and legends. The historical traditions and legacy of Moshoeshoe I remain strong, and there is national pride in Lesothos history of resistance, in the role of the Sotho in building modern Southern Africa, and in the achievements of such writers as Thomas Mokopu Mofolo, who wrote Western-style novels in Sotho, and such composers as Joshua Polumo Mohapeloa (190882).   Cultural institutions The government archives and the national library are located in Maseru. Outside the city is the countrys most important historic site, Thaba Bosiu, which was the centre of Moshoeshoe Is kingdom. Teyateyaneng, the centre of the arts and crafts industries, is also located outside Maseru.   Sports and recreation Sporting activities are extremely popular. Football (soccer) is the most widely played sport in Lesotho, and many of the countrys best players play professionally in South Africa. Judo, boxing, and long-distance running are also popular, the first two benefiting from training facilities provided by the police force. Horse racing is important to rural social life.   Media and publishing Television and radio have done much to improve communication in Lesotho. The state operates both a television and a radio station and provides programming in Sotho and English. There are also several independent radio stations, and radio and television broadcasts from South African stations and global satellite networks can be received in the country. Lesotho has several weekly newspapers published in Sotho and English. Printing presses at mission stations have made a substantial contribution to the religious and educational literature of Southern Africa and have produced such publications as the newspaper Leselinyana la Lesotho (The Little Light of Lesotho), which has been published for more than a century. The countrys first daily paper, The Nation, began publication in 1985. Colin Legum J.J. Guy James Hamilton Cobbe The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica   History  This discussion focuses on Lesotho since the mid-19th century. For a more-detailed treatment of earlier periods and of the country in its regional context, see Southern Africa.  The territory now known as Lesotho was occupied as early as the Neolithic Period (New Stone Age) by Khoisan-speaking hunter-gatherers. From about the 16th century, African farmersthe ancestors of the present populationmoved across the grasslands of Southern Africa and settled in the fertile valleys of the Caledon River, where they came to dominate the hunters of the region. These stock-keeping agriculturalists belonged to the large Sotho group and were divided into numerous clans that formed the nucleus of chiefdoms, whose members occupied villages. "},{"CountryName":"Liberia","CulturalInfo":"Government and society Constitutional framework Monrovia: Temple of JusticeThe Temple of Justice in Monrovia, Liberia(more)Liberias government was patterned after that of the United States, with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Political parties were legalized in 1984, and civilian rule was established in 1986. However, considerable political unrest and violence precluded any stable leadership in power from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s. A power-sharing agreement in 2003 largely ended the fighting and created a National Transitional Government (NTG). The NTG, supported by United Nations peacekeeping troops, replaced the government under the 1986 constitution and ruled until a democratically elected administration was installed in 2006. Liberia is a multiparty republic. Under the 1986 constitution, the head of state and government is the president, who is directly elected for a six-year term. Members of the bicameral National Assembly, who serve six-year terms in the House of Representatives and nine-year terms in the Senate, are also elected directly. Local government For administrative purposes, Liberia is divided into 15 counties. Each of the counties is headed by a superintendent, who is appointed by the president. Justice The judicial system comprises the Supreme Court, an appeals court, magistrate courts, and criminal courts. There are also traditional courts in some communities; the ethnic groups are allowed, as far as possible, to govern themselves according to customary law. Political process The 1986 constitution calls for a multiparty system. Major political parties and organizations include the Unity Party, the Congress for Democratic Change, the Alliance for Peace and Democracy, the United Peoples Party, the National Patriotic Party, and the Liberty Party. The participation of women in Liberias political process was highlighted in late 2005 when Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected president, becoming the first woman to be elected head of state in Africa. In the first decade of the 21st century, women held about one-seventh of seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and some one-third of local government posts. In addition, women have served as ministers and deputy ministers in the cabinet and as justices on the Supreme Court. Health and welfare Conditions in Liberia were poor prior to the civil war, and they deteriorated further after years of war and unrest. Although much progress had been made in providing better health facilities, after the conflict subsided, the majority of these facilities were left in shambles or completely destroyed, especially in the areas beyond Monrovia. International relief organizations operated makeshift hospitals to serve the countrys health care needs, and reestablishing the health care infrastructure was a priority of the government. Malaria and measles are major health problems, and yellow fever, cholera, tuberculosis, and malnutrition are also prevalent. Dysentery, malaria, and diarrhea are major causes of infant mortality, which, at about 150 per 1,000 births, is high by world standards. The occurrence of HIV/AIDS in Liberia is increasing and is of growing concern. Liberias rate of HIV/AIDS, although higher than the world average, is comparable to that of most neighbouring countries and is much lower than that of many other sub-Saharan African countries. Housing Housing in much of the country was damaged or destroyed by civil war and the following years of unrest; hundreds of thousands of Liberians were displaced. The countrys utilities infrastructure was also destroyed. When the fighting subsided in 2003, privately owned generators were, for the most part, the only source of power in the country. Water delivery and sanitation systems were adversely affected by warfare as well, and unsafe water conditions were a major source of disease during and after the conflict. Education Since 1939 education has been compulsory for children between ages 7 and 16 and is free at the primary and secondary levels. Institutes providing higher education include the University of Liberia (1951) in Monrovia, Cuttington University College (1889; Episcopalian) in Suakoko, and the William V.S. Tubman College of Technology (1970) in Harper. There are several vocational schools, including the Booker Washington Institute at Kakata, a government school. The years of civil war and strife that began in the late 1980s and continued into the early 2000s disrupted education in Liberia: students were forced to flee with their families from the violence, and the majority of educational facilities and supplies were destroyed. After the peace accord of 2003, Liberia began the arduous task of rebuilding the countrys educational system.Cultural life Traditional and Western lifestyles coexist; however, traditional values, customs, and norms influence the Western type considerably. In cities both Western and African music and dancing styles are in vogue, but in rural areas traditional rhythms are favoured. Schools instruct students in the legends, traditions, songs, arts, and crafts of African culture, and the government promotes African culture through such agencies as the National Museum in Monrovia, the Tubman Center for African Culture in Robertsport, and the National Cultural Center in Kendeja, which exhibits architecture of the 16 ethnic groups of Liberia. Mask making is an artistic pursuit that is also related to the social structure of some ethnic groups. Music festivals, predominantly religious, are held in most communities. The University of Liberia has an arts and crafts centre. There are several libraries, including a childrens library in Monrovia and a National Public Library. Sports and recreation Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Liberia. An intercounty football competition is held for the annual championship. The University of Liberia and Cuttington University College hold annual sports competitions. Liberias best football player and most popular sports figure is George Weah. Weah used his popularity and personal funds to enable Liberias national team, known as the Lone Stars, to compete in the African Nations Cup competitions during the mid-1990s, despite the ongoing civil war. He also founded a sports school and a youth football club. Media and publishing Monrovia has a number of daily newspapers, including the Daily Observer and The Analyst. A few magazines are published annually. Officially, there is press freedom, but newspapers are banned occasionally for violating government policies on information. Monrovia is served by numerous private radio stations, as well as the state-run Liberia Broadcasting System, and programming includes sports, entertainment, and news. Television networks broadcast local news and foreign films, although local and international football matches tend to be the most popular programs. Satellite television is also available on a subscription basis. International telecommunication services are available through direct satellite links between Liberia, the United States, Italy, and France.Abeodu Bowen Jones The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica "},{"CountryName":"Libya","CulturalInfo":" Political process Qaddafi instituted a government made up of a pyramid-shaped system of congresses and committees topped by the RCC and the GPC. The systems broad base allowed for the wide participation of Libyan citizens, with each group active in the selection of the tier above it. Although in principle governmental ideals called for significant decentralization, Libyas political system was in fact quite centralized. A variety of organizations, including a number of Islamic and pro-democracy groups, opposed the government. Women held seats in the General Peoples Committee, albeit in a small proportion.   Security Libyas armed forces include an army, a navy, and an air force. After the 1970s Libya purchased arms from the Soviet Union and other communist states. Beginning in the mid-1980s, however, military expenditures and arms imports declined. Although Libya had long provided a base and support for foreign militant organizations, by the late 1990s Qaddafis policies began to shift. In 2003 he formally renounced terrorism as part of a broader effort to bring the country back into the global community. Internally, however, Qaddafi created a variety of military and quasi-military organizations over the years that reinforced his authority within the country. Initially important were the Peoples Militia and the Revolutionary Committees, created in 1974 and 1977, respectively. Qaddafi subsequently invested substantial wealth and effort into creating more personal security organizations, such as the Intelligence Bureau of the Leader, the Military Secret Service, the Jamhriyyah Security Organization, the Revolutionary Guards, and the Peoples Guard. Throughout his rule, Qaddafi relied on other informal groups to maintain stability and to protect himself and his interests. After the deposal of Qaddafi, the tasks of ensuring security and keeping order fell to a patchwork of regional and tribal militias that emerged in Libya during the 2011 uprising and its aftermath. Those militias, even the ones nominally aligned with the transitional government, refused to be blended into a national force or to submit to centralized authority. Violent clashes between rival militias were commonplace.   Health and welfare The chief health problems are typhoid, leishmaniasis, rabies, meningitis, and schistosomiasis (a parasitic infestation of the liver or intestines). The incidence of malaria has declined, but gastroenteritis and tetanus remain major diseases. Health care is provided by a mixture of public and private services. Most care is available in hospitals and at outpatient or specialized-care facilities or clinics. Schools for medicine and dentistry opened in the 1970s, but the rapid expansion of facilities necessitated the continued hiring of expatriate staff. The number of medical personnel has been sharply increased. Some graduate medical students study abroad. Libyas six-month civil war in 2011 and the insecurity that followed strained the countrys health and social services, leaving many Libyans without adequate access to medical care.   Housing Housing shortages in Libya intensified following independence owing to increased rates of urban migration. After coming to power, the RCC worked to expand adequate housing through a number of initiatives. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, funds from both public and private sources were directed toward construction projects to improve housing quality and alleviate the strain; nevertheless, shortages remained into the early 21st century. Some of the poorer migrant communities continue to live in informal settlements on the outskirts of a number of the countrys urban areas.   Education Public education is free, although insecurity since the fall of the Qaddafi regime in 2011 has caused disruptions to schools and universities in many areas of the country. Arabic is the language of instruction at all levels. The school system is composed of a six-year primary level, a three-year intermediate and vocational level, and a three-year secondary and advanced vocational level. There are also Qurnic schools, financed by the government. About four-fifths of the adult population is literate. In order to increase the literacy rate, the government also sponsored an adult educational program. Higher education is offered by the state institutions of the University of Libya, subdivided in 1973 into Al-Fte University, located at Tripoli, and Garyounis (Qrynis) University, located at Benghazi. Advanced religious training is obtained at a branch of the university at Al-Bay. Libyan students also study abroad.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Cultural differences between the regions are significant. The population of the west is on the whole more cosmopolitan than that of the east and includes a higher proportion of people of Amazigh, Sub-Saharan African, and Turkish origin. Cyrenaica was profoundly affected by the teachings of the 19th-century Sansiyyah, an Islamic brotherhood, which had little influence in the west and south. The Fezzan was commercially and politically tied to the region historically known as the bild al-sdn (Arabic: land of the black peoples), which spanned the territory south of the Maghrib, Libya, and Egypt from West Africa to the Nilotic Sudan. Since the 1969 coup, lifestyles have been strongly influenced by the revolutionary governments restructuring of national and local government and its efforts to reduce the influence of the tribes. The government has also provided for the education of women and encouraged a broader participation by women in a number of capacities in mainstream Libyan society.   The arts Libyan culture highlights folk art and traditions, which are highly influenced by Islam. The arts of weaving, embroidery, metal engraving, and leatherwork rarely depict people or animals because of the traditional Islamic prohibition against such representations. The dominant geometric and arabesque designs are best presented in the stucco and tiles of the Karamanli and Gurgi mosques of Tripoli. Other traditions include festivals, horse races, and folk dances. Nonreligious literature has developed largely since the 1960s; nationalistic in character, it nonetheless reveals Egyptian influences. The arts are supported by the government through the Ministry of Information, the Ministry of Education and National Guidance, and the Al-Fikr Society, a group of intellectuals and professionals.   Cultural institutions Sabratha, Libya: ancient theatreRemains of the theatre of the ancient city of Sabratha, Libya.(more)Leptis Magna, Libya: Roman basilicaThe remains of the Roman basilica at Leptis Magna, Libya.(more)Libraries include the Government Library and the National Archives in Tripoli, the National Library of Libya and the Public Library in Benghazi, the library of the Libyan Studies Centre, and the university libraries.

The Sabh Museum contains exhibits of ancient remains from the Fezzan region. As part of a historical region valued by many successive empires, numerous rich cultural and archaeological sites are located in present-day Libya. The remains of the ancient cities of Cyrene, Leptis Magna, Sabratha, and Ghadames, as well as the ancient rock art at Tadrart Acacus, have all been recognized as UNESCOWorld Heritage sites.   Sports and recreation Football (soccer) is one of the most popular sports in Libya. The top national league includes a number of teams, and Tripoli and Benghazi are each home to several clubs. Al-Ahl of Tripoli has won numerous league titles since the 1960s. The national team was prohibited from participating in international competitions during the UN embargo, but the team returned to the world football stage in the spring of 1999 with an exhibition game against Senegal. Racing is very popular in Libya. Horse racing is a traditional part of many holiday celebrations, and automobile racing also has a strong following. Tripoli was once a stop on the Grand Prix tour; the 1933 race became infamous when several drivers conspired to fix it. Libyans also enjoy tennis, and water sports are gaining popularity on the coast. Libya made its Olympic debut at the 1968 Mexico City Games.   Media and publishing The government controls broadcasting and the press. Newspapers and periodicals are published by the Jamahiriya News Agency (JANA), government secretariats, the Press Service, and trade unions. JANA publishes Al-Fajr al-Jadd (New Dawn) in Tripoli. Daily newspapers include Al-Shams (The Sun) and Al-Zaf al-Akhar (The Green March). Radio broadcasts from Tripoli and Benghazi are in Arabic and English; the national television service broadcasts in Arabic, with limited hours in English, Italian, and French. Several publishers of general and academic books are located in Tripoli. Dennis D. Cordell Mukhtar Mustafa Buru Gary L. Fowler  "},{"CountryName":"Lithuania","CulturalInfo":" Education of LithuaniaA new national educational system was introduced in 1990. Primary and secondary education is free and compulsory beginning at age six. More than nine-tenths of the population age 15 and older are literate. Notable institutions of higher education include Vilnius University (1579), Vytautas Magnus University (founded 1922; reopened 1989) in Kaunas, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (1956), and the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre (1933), which specializes in music, theatre, and multimedia arts. The Lithuanian Academy of Sciences was founded in 1941.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu In Lithuania there is a high level of interest in various aspects of cultural life. In spite of modern influences, Lithuanian folklore continues to be a significant part of national heritage. Lithuanian songs and a remarkable collection of fairy tales, legends, proverbs, and aphorisms have roots deep in a language and culture that are among the oldest in Europe. In the 20th century, however, war and Soviet occupation stifled the works of many Lithuanian artists, writers, poets, and playwrights.   Daily life and social customs As a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Lithuania celebrates all the major Christian holidays. The traditional Christmas Eve feast consists of 12 vegetarian dishes served on a straw-covered table, meat being saved for Christmas Day. Cabbages and potatoes form a considerable part of the Lithuanian diet, as do dairy products. Traditional dishes include cepelinai, a large, zeppelin-shaped, stuffed potato dumpling; cabbage rolls; cold beet soup; and potato pancakes.    The arts Lithuanian folk art is mainly embodied in ceramics, leatherwork, wood carving, and textiles; its colouring and its original geometric or floral patterns are characteristic features. Lithuanian drawing, noted for the use of natural colour and a highly refined technique, has won international acclaim. The Vilnius Drawing School, founded in 1866, has had a strong influence on the countrys fine arts traditions. The composer and painter Mikalojus Konstantinas iurlionis (18751911), considered one of Lithuanias most outstanding artists of the early 20th century, was actively involved with the school. Moreover, some of the Lithuanian artists who opposed Soviet ideological constraints produced theatre and art of lasting significance. After the second Soviet occupation in 1944, many Lithuanian artists emigrated and founded art galleries and schools, mainly in other parts of Europe and in North America.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tMore From Britannica\t\tBaltic states: Independent Lithuania\t\n Lithuanias musical traditions did not develop until the late 19th century. From 1918 to 1940 cultural societies, choirs, and orchestras were formed. In 1924 the first all-Lithuanian song festival was held in Kaunas. Romantic songs combined with Lithuanian folk music became a popular style. One of the most well-known composers and the founder of the Kaunas Conservatory (1933), Lithuanias first university-level music school, was Juozas Gruodis (18841948). Lithuanians are especially proud of their sutartins, an ancient and unique form of typically two- and three-voiced polyphony notable for its parallel seconds. Song and dance festivals are held every summer throughout the country. Vilnius hosts the National Song and Dance Festival, the International M.K. iurlionis Piano and Organ Competition, and the International Balys Dvarionas Competition for Young Pianists and Violinists. Music festivals are also held in iauliai, Birtonas, and Panevys. Jazz has a strong following, and many jazz clubs can be found in Vilnius. Until the 18th century most Lithuanian literature was religious in nature. During the 19th century there arose a new movement to create a Lithuanian literary language and foster interest in the early history of the country. The literature of this era sought to rally Lithuanians against the political control of Russia and the cultural influence of Poland. Following independence in 1918, writers began to concentrate on developing national culture and a greater degree of sophistication in literature. Foremost among this group was Vincas Krv-Mickieviius, a novelist and dramatist who often used traditional folk songs and legends in his works, and he is regarded by many as one of the greatest Lithuanian writers.   Cultural institutions The Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet (1920) in Vilnius is of international renown. Museums of note include the National Museum of Lithuania in Vilnius, the Trakai Historical Museum (featuring artifacts discovered at the island castle at Trakai), and a war museum in Kaunas dedicated to Vytautas the Great. The Mikalojus Konstantinas iurlionis National Art Museum, also in Kaunas, displays the works of the distinguished artist, as well as Lithuanian folk art and other national art. The open-air Rumiks Museum of Folk Art, located between Kaunas and Vilnius, includes re-created villages depicting 19th-century Lithuanian life in different regions of the country. Martynas Mavydas National Library of Lithuania in Vilnius (founded 1919) includes documents dating from the 15th century. Vilnius Universitys Yiddish Institute (founded 2001) was created to preserve and enrich Yiddish and East European Jewish culture.   Sports and recreation Football (soccer) is Lithuanias most popular sport, and the country boasts several professional leagues. Basketball has grown in popularity, and Lithuanias team has excelled in international competitions. Several of the countrys leading players, including ydrunas Ilgauskas, arunas Marciulionis, and Arvydas Sabonis, have plied their trade in North Americas National Basketball Association. Cross-country skiing, ice skating, ice hockey, and ice fishing on Curonian Lagoon are favourite winter pastimes. Bicycling and canoeing are popular in the summer. Lithuanias first Olympic appearance was at the 1924 Winter Games in Chamonix, France. After World War II, Lithuanian athletes competed for the Soviet Olympic team. Lithuania was able to again contend as an independent country at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. Lithuanian discus throwers have been especially successful in Olympic competition, including gold medalists Romas Ubartas (1992) and Virgilijus Alekna (2000, 2004). Lithuania has also fared well in Olympic basketball.   Media and publishing Prior to independence the media were state-owned and controlled by the Communist Party, mainly through state censors. Media censorship was abolished in 1989, and much of the media flourished as the economy became more liberalized. By the 21st century all newspapers were privately owned, though the Lithuanian Telegraph Agency (ELTA), a wire service that serves the local media in Lithuanian and Russian, was state-owned. Several daily newspapers are published in Vilnius, including Lietuvos Rytas (Lithuanias Morning, also published in Russian), Kurier Wileski (Vilnius Courier, published in Polish), and Lietuvos Aidas (Echo of Lithuania, also published in Russian). There are no government-owned newspapers. Both radio and television stations are a mixture of private and state-owned. The languages of broadcast for both media are Lithuanian, Russian, Polish, Belarusian, and Ukrainian, and there are also some Yiddish radio broadcasts. Kazimieras Mekauskas James H.

The government operates the postal service in Luxembourg. RTL (Radio-Television-Luxembourg) Group SA, a privately owned broadcasting company that has radio and television outlets in a number of European countries, is also a satellite operator with a plethora of channels that reach as far as Great Britain and Scandinavia. RTL is arguably Europes most important private radio and television broadcaster.Government and society Luxembourg city: Grand Ducal PalaceGrand Ducal Palace, in the old quarter of Luxembourg city.(more)The grand duchy is a constitutional monarchy with hereditary succession. Executive power authority lies with the grand duke, who appoints the prime minister. The powers of the grand duke are primarily formal, however. Actual executive power lies with the prime minister and his ministerial council, or cabinet, who are responsible to the Chamber of Deputies. The members of this legislative assembly are elected by popular vote to five-year terms. Voting by all adult citizens, begun in 1919, is compulsory. Legislative elections have usually given rise to coalition governments formed alternatively by two of the three major parties: the Christian Social Peoples Party (Chrschtlech Sozial Vollekspartei; CSV), the Socialist Workers Party of Luxembourg (Ltzebuergesch Sozialistesch Arbechterpartei; LSAP), and the Democratic Party (DP). In addition, a Council of State named by the grand duke functions as an advisory body. It is consulted on all draft legislation, advises the grand duke on administrative affairs, and serves as a supreme court in case of administrative disputes. There are also three advisory bodies that are consulted before the passage of legislation affecting their particular area of the national life. The first of these consists of six confederations, three of which represent employers (commerce, guilds, and farmers) and three of which represent labour (workers, private employees, and civil servants). The second advisory group, the Social and Economic Council, has become a major committee for the examination of all projects. The third, the Immigration Council, advises the government on problems involving housing and the political rights of immigrants. Justice is in the hands of magistrates appointed for life by the grand duke, the final appeal lying with the Superior Court of Justice. In the criminal court of assizes, six magistrates sit as jury as well as judge.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tBritannica Quiz\t\tYou Name It!\t\n Luxembourg is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and has a small volunteer army. There is also a small paramilitary gendarmerie. Luxembourg is divided administratively into three districts, each of which is headed by a commissioner appointed by the central government. Each district is in turn divided into cantons and subdivided into communes, or municipalities. Public works, health, and education are among the responsibilities of the communes, each of which is governed by an elected council and a mayor. These bodies also maintain liaison with the central government and act as its local agents. Health and welfare After World War I a broad system of social security and health services was introduced in Luxembourg to ensure maximum welfare protection to each citizen. Sickness benefits, in which patients pay only a small part of medical costs, as well as birth, family, and unemployment payments, are included in the plans. Housing conditions are generally comparable to those found in other western European countries. There has been some difficulty, however, in assimilating the many thousands of foreign workers and their families. Education Education is compulsory from age 6 to 15. The educational system offers a mix of primary and secondary schools run by state and local governments and by religious institutions. Considerable emphasis is laid on language studies. The principal language of instruction is Luxembourgish; however, German is introduced in the first year, and French is added in the second year. German remains the focus throughout primary school and in technical education, while in secondary classical education the emphasis is on French. Until the early 21st century there were no four-year universities in the grand duchy, so many young Luxembourgers have historically obtained their higher education abroad. In 2003 the University of Luxembourg was founded in Luxembourg city and now provides undergraduate and graduate degrees.Cultural life The major cultural institution of Luxembourg is the Grand Ducal Institute, which has sections devoted to history, science, medicine, languages and folklore, arts and literature, and moral and political sciences. It functions as an active promoter of the arts, humanities, and general culture rather than as a conservator. The Luxembourg National Museum (formally the National Museum of History and Art) surveys  fine arts and industrial arts as well as  the history of Luxembourg. Other prominent museums include the Villa VaubanMuseum of the Art of the City of Luxembourg, MUDAM Luxembourg (Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art), the Museum of the History of the City of Luxembourg, and the National Museum of Natural History. There is considerable public use of the National Library, the National Archives, and the Music Conservatory of the City of Luxembourg. The grand duchy also maintains cultural agreements with several European and other nations that provide it with the finest in the musical and theatrical arts. The Philharmonic Orchestra of Luxembourg (which was known as the Grand Orchestra of Radiotelevision Luxembourg before it came under government administration in 1996) is considered outstanding. There is an extensive market in Luxembourg city for works of painting and sculpture, both traditional and modern. The grand duchys architectural heritage extends through practically the entire span of Europes recorded history, from ancient Gallo-Roman villas to medieval castles, Gothic and Baroque churches, and contemporary buildings. A small publishing industry exists, printing literary works in French, German, and Luxembourgish. The grand duchys newspapers express diverse political points of viewconservative, liberal, socialist, and communist. Luxembourgs influence is felt far beyond its borders through the medium of the RTL (Radio-Television-Luxembourg) Group. The groups early English-language radio service, Radio Luxembourg, played an important role in the history of rock music when it operated as Europes premier broadcaster of rhythm and blues and early rock and roll from the United States in the 1950s. Victor J.P. Biel Jean-Pierre Erpelding Jean Marie Gehring The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"},{"CountryName":"Madagascar","CulturalInfo":"Local government For administrative purposes, Madagascar is divided into a system of decentralized territorial collectivities: provinces, regions, and communes. The provinces, the largest units, are further divided into regions, which are subdivided into communes. Each province is administered by a directly elected head of the province and an elected provincial council. Regional administrations follow a similar structure, with a directly elected head of the region and an elected regional council. Communes, which are classified as either urban or rural, have directly elected administrations. Justice The former Merina state that ruled the island throughout the 19th century had an elaborate system of laws, courts, and justice. The present legal system, however, is based upon French codes and practices. There is a High Constitutional Court, a High Court of Justice, a Supreme Court, Courts of Appeal, and tribunals. Security The army played no direct political role in Madagascar until 1972, although the presence of French army units had bolstered the former government. The French troops were withdrawn in 1973, and the French naval base at Antsiranana was handed over to Madagascar in 1975. The Malagasy armed forces consist of an army, a navy, and an air force. There is also a large paramilitary force, as well as a secret police. Detachments of local police are stationed at the headquarters of each administrative division, as well as in Antananarivo. The whole force is under unified command and falls within the responsibility of the ministry of the interior. Health and welfare The majority of Malagasy citizens live in rural areas. Conditions of life vary greatly from region to region; some regions, especially those where cash crops are grown, are relatively prosperous and well-linked with the cities, while othersparticularly those in the southare isolated and subject to periodic famine. All regions are dependent on agriculture, and the eastern regions suffer frequently from the devastating cyclones that are a feature of the Malagasy climate. Rural areas generally lack many of the amenities that are available to even the urban poor, including access to electricity, running water, and safe drinking water. Although infant mortality remains significantly higher than the world average, infant deaths from malaria, which is endemic all over the island, have been much reduced. Debilitating parasitic diseases, such as schistosomiasis, an infection of the bladder or intestines, remain serious and are hard to control, since the parasites breeding grounds are the irrigated rice fields and the streams that feed them. Sexually transmitted diseases are also widespread, although Madagascar has one of the lowest rates of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Malagasy doctors began to practice Western medicine in the late 19th century, and a medical school was established in Antananarivo in 1897. The health system includes principal and secondary hospitals, dispensaries, and medical centres. Medical personnel include doctors as well as pharmacists, dentists, midwives, social assistants, visiting nurses, and health assistants. However, there is a significantly imbalanced patient-to-doctor ratio, in part because many of those graduating with health care-related degrees from Malagasy institutions have been drawn to other sectors or to more lucrative positions abroad. Furthermore, hospitals and specialists are located mainly in the towns, with the exception of some rural hospitals run by Christian missions, and it is difficult for many Malagasy citizens to access health care facilities. Health insurance and other social benefits are available mainly to better-paid workers and professionals among the employed population. Housing Houses are typically rectangular and crowned with steeply angled roofs. In the rural areas, most houses are made of either mud and wattle or woven matting supported by poles. In the eastern forest, they are built of interlaced split bamboo and are thatched with palm. In the south, overlapping upright wooden planks are used for walls. On the plateau, rural housing is constructed of earth blocks and thatched roofing, while upper-income and most urban housing consists of two- or three-story homestypically with the kitchen at the top, living quarters in the middle, and storage belowall surrounded by wide balconies supported by brick columns and crowned with steep tiled roofs. This is the lofty Indonesian style of architecture, transformed by new techniques contributed by the missionaries. The original style survives in the house of King Andrianampoinimerina (reigned 17871810) at Ambohimanga and reached its pinnacle in the Queens Palace built by Jean Laborde in the 19th century; the palace was destroyed by fire in 1995. The government-sponsored housing authority conducts research into design, materials, and production methods and is seeking to promote inexpensive urban housing, but the problem of overcrowding is expected to increase with continued urban growth. Education The educational system consists of primary and secondary schools, technical institutes, teacher-training colleges, and a university system. Education is compulsory between ages 6 and 13. Primary education, which is free, begins at age six and consists of five years of study. Secondary education consists of a four-year cycle of study, followed by a three-year cycle. Universities in Madagascar include the University of Antananarivo (1961), the University of Mahajanga (1977), and the University of Fianarantsoa (1988). There has been an increased use of the Malagasy language in teaching, although some coastal peoples have objected because of the written languages close relationship to the Merina people. The level of school attendance and educational attainment is higher on the plateau than in the coastal areas. Protestant and Roman Catholic missions have been providing education since the 19th century, and the missions continue to educate a large proportion of the schoolchildren, although the government maintains official schools at all levels and is attempting to phase out private education. In the main towns there are other privately run schools, which serve those unable to enter either government or mission schools. About two-thirds of women and about three-fourths of men in Madagascar are literate, a trend that indicates a remarkable increase in the countrys overall rate of literacy since the mid-1960s, when less than two-fifths of the population was literate.Cultural life Cultural milieu Malagasy culture is largely composed of Indonesian elements, with other influences evident. Arabic and Islamic contributions include sikidy, an intricate system of divination, and calendrical features, such as the Arabic-derived names of the days of the week, which also apply to the markets held on those days. The coastal areas of the west, north, and south might be expected to show African cultural elements, but, apart from some Bantu words, these are often difficult to identify conclusively. "},{"CountryName":"Malawi","CulturalInfo":" Education of MalawiMalawi: outdoor classroomTeacher and schoolchildren in an outdoor classroom, Malawi.(more)Primary education, which begins at age six and lasts for eight years, is compulsory. Secondary education, made up of two cycles of two years each, begins at age 14. Primary education was made free in 1994, leading to a considerable increase in the already high student-teacher ratio and underscoring the growing need for the expansion of postprimary education. Efforts have been made to bridge the gap in personnel and resources, including teacher training programs intended to reduce the pupil-to-teacher ratio, curriculum development and reform, and the construction of new classrooms. Part of the response to free primary education and the consequent need for more room in secondary schools has been the proliferation of privately owned schools. Through numerous Distance Education Centres (DECs), the Malawi College of Distance Education has been available to students unable to attend regular secondary school. In the late 1990s, however, the DECs were converted into Community Day Secondary Schools, which further increased the need for teaching staff. Kamuzu Academy at Mtunthama, which opened in 1981 as a selective secondary school, has increasingly become limited to those who can afford its very high fees. Efforts have been made to meet the urgent demand for more teachers. In addition to the various training colleges that specialize in primary education, facilities and programs are being improved at institutes that also focus on secondary education, including the Domasi College of Education (1993) and the University of Mzuzu (1999). Secondary teacher education also features prominently at the Chancellor College campus of the University of Malawi (1964), the countrys oldest and largest university. In addition to the Chancellor College, the University of Malawis other constituent colleges include a liberal arts college in Zomba, a medical school and a Polytechnic in Blantyre, and colleges of agriculture and nursing in Lilongwe. The minimum qualification for entry into the universities is a good grade in the Malawi School Certificate of Education Examination, which is administered by the Malawi National Examination Board. There are several vocational training centres in Malawi, specializing mainly in masonry, carpentry, printing, motor mechanics, and welding.   Cultural life  Daily life and social customs Many Malawians observe holidays celebrated by Christian societies throughout the world, including Easter and Christmas. Holidays celebrated by the Muslim communityincluding d al-Fir, which marks the end of Ramadan, and d al-A, which marks the culmination of the hajjare governed by the lunar calendar. In addition to these, other holidays include John Chilembwe Day on January 15, in honour of the missionary who was a forerunner of Malawian nationalism; Martyrs Day on March 3, commemorating those who lost their lives in a 1959 uprising against the British colonial administration; Freedom Day on June 14, in honour of the many Malawians who struggled for the countrys transition to a multiparty democracy during the early 1990s; Republic Day on July 6, commemorating Malawian independence; Labour Day on May 1; and Mothers Day, which is celebrated in October.   The arts Various traditional arts and crafts, including sculpture in wood and ivory, form part of Malawis material and aesthetic culture. A variety of musical forms, both local and international, are also important. One of the most distinctive features of Malawian culture is the enormous variety of traditional songs and dances that feature the drum as the major musical instrument. Among the most notable of these dances are ingoma and gule wa mkulu, performed by men, and chimtali and visekese, performed by women. Through domestic broadcasts and international broadcasts received by way of shortwave radio, Malawiansespecially those of the younger generationshave always been part of world pop culture and enjoy many international musical artists. Western popular music forms a major repertoire on local radio. It is associated with the more modern urban nightclubs, and most town-based local artists play it rather than music with a strictly African-sounding beat. African styles of pop music are also very popular among all ages in Malawi, however, and, because of strong historical ties with South Africa, township music such as mbaqanga has always occupied a significant place in the Malawian musical culture. Equally notable is the popularity of Congolese music (a mixture of traditional African rhythms and instruments and those borrowed from other cultures), which, along with mbaqanga, tends to be played in both villages and bars in the urban centres.   Cultural institutions Important artifacts of Malawian history, art, and culture are preserved in the countrys museums, including the Malawi Museum, also known as the Chichiri Museum, in Blantyre; the Lake Malawi Museum, which displays ethnographic and historical exhibits, in Mangochi; the Cultural Museum Center, which features items of natural and cultural significance, in Karonga; and the Chamare Museum at Mua Catholic Mission, which specializes in arts and crafts and has training facilities for prospective sculptors. In addition, Malawian cultural expression is also preserved in situ at such locations as the Chongoni rock-art area (designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2006), where more than 100 sites feature rock paintings by agriculturalists and hunter-gatherers, the oldest of which may date back to the 6th century bce. The Malawi National Dance Troupe (formerly the Kwacha Cultural Troupe), formed in 1987, works to preserve the performing arts culture of various ethnic groups; the Chancellor College Travelling Theatre (affiliated with the University of Malawi), the Wakhumbata Theatre Ensemble, and other groups in Blantyre and Lilongwe have been an effective means of bringing traditional and modern plays to rural and urban populations.   Sports and recreation Most people in rural Malawi spend their time attending to their farms; when they are not doing sowhich is usually in the dry monthsthey may visit their friends or go to local school football (soccer) matches, often played on weekends on rough and uneven grounds. In many areas men play bawo, similar to checkers. Dance competitions, pitting teams from different areas against one another, are also popular in rural Malawi. Football, boxing, netball, cinema, and theatre arts play a major role in the leisure life of urban Malawians. National football squads frequently compete in matches in neighbouring countries, but, because of a shortage of travel funds, they seldom venture far. In September 1999 the government awarded the Malawi Council of Sports a sizable grant to improve the countrys sporting infrastructure and allow Malawian teams to travel abroad more regularly. Malawian athletes have distinguished themselves in the sport of netball and have sent teams to the World Netball Championships and to the African Games. Malawi formed a national Olympic committee in 1968 and was recognized by the International Olympic Committee that year. Malawian athletes have attended most Summer Games since that time but did join in the boycotts of the 1976 and 1980 games.   Media and publishing A variety of publications are circulated in Malawi. Widely read publications include The Daily Times, published in English; Malawi News, a weekly published in Chewa and English; The Nation, a daily published in English and Nyanja; The Mirror, a weekly published in English and Nyanja; and Odini, published fortnightly in Chewa and English. Of the periodicals in distribution, Boma Lathu, which is published quarterly in Chewa by the Ministry of Information, is the most widely circulated; Moni Magazine and This Is Malawimonthlies published in both Chewa and Englishare also important. The state-owned Malawi Broadcasting Corporation is the major radio broadcaster in the country. Until 1994, programs were broadcast only in Chewa and English; programs have since been made available in additional languages, including Yao, Tumbuka, Lomwe, Sena, and Tonga. There are also a number of commercial radio stations in operation, some of which are operated by the countrys various religious organizations. TV Malawi, the first television establishment, started operating in 1999, initially in Blantyre and Lilongwe. Until that time, only those with satellite dishes and access to M-Net, a South African subscription television service, had any access to this form of entertainment. TV Malawi broadcasts both local and international programming. Zimani David Kadzamira Owen Jato Kalinga  "},{"CountryName":"Malaysia","CulturalInfo":"Security of MalaysiaThe Malaysian armed forces have increased in strength and capability since the formation of Malaysia in 1963. After the withdrawal of British military forces from Malaysia and Singapore at the end of 1971, a five-country agreement between Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom was concluded to ensure defense against external aggression. Additional regional security is provided by ASEAN. The armed forces consist of an army, a navy, and an air force. The army is the most experienced and the largest of the three units, constituting roughly three-fourths of all military personnel. The Royal Malaysian Navy concentrates mainly on defending the long indented coastlines and narrow waters of the country. The Royal Malaysian Air Force has combat aircraft as well as many transport aircraft and helicopters. Military service is voluntary, with a minimum age requirement of 18 years. The states of Malaysia inherited from their common colonial past an internal security system based on the British model. The police force is well trained and combats not only crime but also armed insurrections. As a paramilitary unit, the police are separate from the armed forces. Health and welfare The general level of health improved considerably in the second half of the 20th century. This improvement not only contributed significantly to a decline in death and infant mortality rates but also, by the 21st century, largely freed Malaysia from many of the diseases that plague tropical countries. Such diseases as malaria remain a problem in some rural areas, however. Health conditions and health facilities vary among the states, but facilities are generally better equipped and staffed in Peninsular Malaysia than in Sabah and Sarawak. Health services generally are more extensive in the towns and cities than in the rural areas. Segments of the rural population often rely to some extent on traditional treatments rather than on doctors and medicines that are the product of formal research and academic training. Most health services are provided by the government. Welfare services, however, are provided by both government and private agencies and include relief programs for senior citizens, for the economically disadvantaged, and for people with disabilities. Housing The multicultural character of the population of Malaysia is visibly reflected in the wide variety of houses, which range from the traditional longhouses and stilt houses of the rural peoples to examples of modern high-rise architecture in the cities. Housing shortages are rare in rural areas, but squatter settlements are common in the larger towns and cities. A governmental housing authority has had success in establishing low-cost housing in urban areas. Education The federal government allocates a significant portion of its budget to education, and it provides free public schooling at the primary and secondary levels. Although only six years of primary education (from age six) are compulsory, most children receive at least some secondary education. Secondary school consists of one three-year segment followed by a four-year segment; students may enroll in a technical or vocational school (in lieu of pursuing a strictly academic curriculum) for their second segment of secondary study. The number of students advancing to the postsecondary level rose rapidly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The country offers dozens of tertiary institutions, including universities, teacher-training colleges, and other public and private institutions with assorted specializations. Among the most prominent institutions of higher learning are the University of Malaya (1962) in Kuala Lumpur, the University of Science, Malaysia (1969) in Penang, the National University of Malaysia (1970) in Bangi, and the International Islamic University (1983) in Kuala Lumpur. Major state universities were established in Sarawak and Sabah in the mid-1990s.Cultural life Cultural milieu Malaysia is a point of convergence of several major cultural traditions that stem from archipelagic Southeast Asia as well as from China, South Asia, the Middle East, and the West. Malay culture, the Orang Asli cultures of Peninsular Malaysia, and many of the cultures of East Malaysia are indigenous to the area. In the first one and a half millennia ce, indigenous Malay culture in the Malay Peninsula and in other parts of Southeast Asia was strongly marked by pre-Islamic Indian and early Islamic influences. Indian contact with the Malay Peninsula, which extended from about the 2nd or 3rd century to the late 14th century, exerted a profound influence on religion (through Hinduism and Buddhism), art, and literature. Islam, introduced to Malacca (now Melaka) in the 15th century, soon became the dominant religion of the Malays. Western cultural influences, especially since the 19th century, also have affected many aspects of Malay life, particularly in the realms of technology, law, social organization, and economics. Contemporary Malay culture is thus multifaceted, consisting of many strandsindigenous, early Hindu, early and modern Islamic, and, especially in the cities, Westerninterwoven to yield a pattern that is distinct from other cultures yet recognizably Malay. The early Chinese traders who settled in Malacca and on the island of Penang were partially assimilated (at least to the extent of adopting the Malay language). By contrast, the Chinese who emigrated in large numbers to the Malay Peninsula in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were both a more heterogeneous group and a largely transient population that tended to establish self-contained communities. Chinese cultural influence in this region, then, has been less pronounced. Most of the Indians and Pakistanis originally came as labourers to work in the coffee and rubber plantations from the mid-19th to the early 20th centuries. Like the Chinese, they also were mainly transients (until World War II), living in closed communities and remaining relatively unassimilated. The communities of Malaysia have been affected profoundly by British colonial rule and Western cultural influences, especially in education and institutional forms. The rural areasparticularly in eastern Peninsular Malaysia and in the interior of East Malaysiahave been least affected, while the cities have been the focus of the most-rapid cultural changes. However, extraordinary economic growth and development since the mid-20th century increasingly has allowed a cosmopolitan outlook, carried largely from the urban centres by an expanding middle class, to penetrate smaller towns and even newer rural settlements. "},{"CountryName":"Mali","CulturalInfo":" Political process Since 1960, new law codes have liberated women from traditional restraints, defined the rights and duties of citizens, and modified the penal procedure. The 1992 constitution furthered womens rights considerably, although constitutionally guaranteed rights for women have not always been carried out in practice. Mali has universal adult suffrage. Women and minorities have served in government positions, but in limited numbers: in the early 21st century, ethnic minorities and marginalized populations together held about one-tenth of the National Assembly seats, as did women. Women have also held cabinet posts and served on the Supreme Court, and the countrys first female prime minister was appointed in 2011. The country has had political parties at various times since it gained independence in 1960. Under the first president, Modibo Keita, the Soudanese Union Party eventually became the only party until the military took over in 1968. Civilian government returned in 1979, when the country was led again by a one-party system, this time the Malian Peoples Democratic Union, headed by Moussa Traor, who was ultimately deposed in 1991 in favour of another military government, led by Amadou Toumani Tour. Political parties were once again allowed in 1992, and Alpha Konar, of the Alliance for Democracy in Mali, was elected president that year. Since then, many political parties have been active in Mali.   Security Mali has a conscripted army, which requires two years of service, including the possibility of nonmilitary service. Malis military forces include army and air force contingents and a limited navy contingent as well. Paramilitary forces include the national police force, the republican guard, the militia, and gendarmerie units. Foreign troopsincluding French troops and those under the banner of the African-led International Support Mission in Mali (AFISMA) and a UN peacekeeping operation, the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA)were present in Mali since 2013 to thwart the actions of Islamist fighters and maintain security while the country recovered from the 2012 coup and prepared for fresh elections.   Health and welfare Mali has few resources for health care, and child and infant mortality rates are among the highest in the world. State hospitals at Bamako and Kati are supplemented by a network of medical centres, maternity centres, dispensaries, and a mobile service that visits patients in rural areas. Research centres in tropical ophthalmology and leprosy treat patients at Bamako. Health care services are also provided by international relief organizations. Despite improvements in medical care, Mali is still challenged by a lack of personnel, facilities, resources, and supplies and by difficulties involving poor access to much of the country. Malnutrition and inadequate sanitation are also problems in many areas. Some progress has been made against polio, onchocerciasis (river blindness), schistosomiasis, and leprosy, but yellow fever and cholera are common, and malaria remains a leading cause of death. While Mali has not been hit as hard by HIV as some African countries, AIDS is becoming more prevalent in urban areas.   Housing Mali: Dogon cliff villageCharacteristic Dogon cliff village on the Bandiagara Escarpment.(more)Dogon housingTypical Dogon village, Mali.(more)Lac Dbo, central MaliMud houses on an island in Lac Dbo, central Mali.(more)Houses in Mali are typically built of a mixture of earth and cement. Malian towns exhibit an eclectic mix of styles, including traditional mud huts, concrete houses, European-style villas, and mosques and government buildings in the Sudanese style. The Dogon built their houses into the Bandiagara Escarpment, which was designated a World Heritage site in 1989. These houses, built out of mud, have flat roofs where the inhabitants can sleep in warm weather, and their granaries have thatched conical roofs; both structures have decorative doors. Other houses, such as historic dwellings found in Djenn, were built on small hills to protect from seasonal flooding.   Education French, spoken by only a very small segment of the population, was the only language of instruction until 1994, when national languages such as Bambara and Fula were introduced into primary schools. Mali utilizes an educational track resembling the school system in France, Malis former colonial authority. In this system, primary and secondary education are compulsory and free from 7 to 16 years of age and are combined in the nine-year curriculum of the cycle fondemental (fundamental educational level). The general secondary school, or lyce, provides the last three years of traditional secondary education. Higher educationgeared directly to the needs of the governmentis offered by the University of Bamako (1993) and state colleges, which include teacher-training colleges, a college of administration, an engineering institute, an agricultural and veterinary science institute, and a medical school. Many of Malis university students study abroad, especially in France and Senegal. Other school reform has focused on such programs as ruralization, in which rural schools teach students about trades such as sewing, building, and farming in addition to such subjects as French, history, mathematics, and geography. In the early 21st century, Mali remained a vast, poor country where opportunities for even primary education were extremely limited, especially in rural areas or among the nomadic peoples of the north. The World Bank began to assist Mali in 2000 by providing credit so that the country could expand its educational system. At that time only slightly more than half the population entered primary school. Expanding educational opportunities for the female population was also of interest to the Malian government. The countrys literacy rate is one of the lowest in the world, with estimates varying between two-fifths and one-third of the population being able to read. The literacy rate of women is significantly lower than that of men.   Cultural life Mali has long functioned as a crossroads between northern and western Africa and has thus developed a rich cultural tradition. In addition, its location between the Arab nations to the north and the sub-Saharan African nations to the south has for centuries made it a cultural meeting place. Mali: Djenn Great Mosque and open-air marketThe open-air market near the mosque in Djenn, Mali.(more)Weekly markets are held throughout Mali, often on a rotating basis in specific areas. Handwoven textiles, fresh fish, agricultural products, and other goods are purchased or traded at these bustling and well-attended markets. Herders bring their sheep, goats, and other livestock for sale and exchange. Malians travel long distances to attend the markets, which are also centres of social interaction. All ethnic groups participate; sometimes certain parts of the markets are reserved for a particular ethnic groups wares. For Malis considerable Muslim population, mosques are an important centre of cultural and social life, especially on Fridays, when weekly prayer services are held. Cuisine in Mali is similar to that of other countries in the region; staples include millet, rice, yams, plantains, beans, and cassava (manioc). Fish, whether dried or fresh, is also enjoyed. Fruit from the baobab tree is used as porridge when drought conditions exist. Christian holidays, including Christmas and Easter, and Muslim holidays, including Tabaski (also known as d al-A, marking the culmination of the hajj rites near Mecca) and Korit (also known as d al-Fir, marking the end of Ramadan), are observed in Mali. In addition, the country also celebrates Armed Forces Day on January 20, Democracy Day on March 26, Labour Day on May 1, Africa Day on May 25, and National Independence Day on September 22. An unusual day is National Complaints Day, invented in 1994; on that day any Malian citizen can present complaints to the government with impunity. "},{"CountryName":"Malta","CulturalInfo":"Government and societyConstitutional frameworkThe 1964 constitution, under which Malta became an independent monarchy and parliamentary state, was amended in 1974 to make Malta a republic within the Commonwealth. Malta is currently a unitary multiparty republic. The Maltese parliament consists of a unicameral House of Representatives and is fashioned on the British model. Members of the parliament are elected by proportional representation for five-year terms. An amendment adopted in 1996 guarantees a majority of seats to a party receiving more than 50 percent of the total votes cast in the general election. The parliament appoints the president, who is head of state. The president acts on the advice of the cabinet, which is headed by the prime minister, who is the head of the government.Local governmentLocal government was established in Malta in 1993. The country is divided into 68 localities, 14 of which are in Gozo. Each locality is administered by a local council elected by the residents of the locality by proportional representation every three years. The Department for Local Government oversees the councils.JusticeMaltese law, which was codified mainly during the period from 1854 to 1873, is largely based on the Napoleonic Code and Napoleonic law. Criminal proceedings and fiscal and maritime legislation follow English common law, but judicial precedent is not binding. Maltese is the language of the courts. Civil and criminal jurisdiction is almost exclusively vested in the Superior Courts and the Court of Magistrates. The chief justice and other members of the judiciary are appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister.Political processMaltese citizens aged 18 and older are eligible to vote. The island is deeply polarized in its politics; since independence the two major parties, the Nationalist Party (Partit Nazzjonalista; PN) and the Malta Labour Party (Partit Laburista; MLP), have alternated in power. The Democratic Alternative (Alternattiva Demokratika; AD), also known as the Maltese Green Party, is Maltas third party but has not secured a parliamentary seat since its founding in 1989. Voter turnout in Malta has traditionally been high, with generally more than nine-tenths of eligible voters casting ballots.SecurityBetween 1964 and 1972, Maltas main defense dispositions were those contained in a 1964 agreement with the United Kingdom guaranteeing mutual assistance. From 1972 to 1987 Malta followed a policy of nonalignment, and in 1987 a neutrality clause was included in its constitution. Malta maintains its own regular armed forces. Military service is voluntary for those of at least age 18.Health and welfareThe government of Malta has always played a central role in the provision of health care by offering a comprehensive array of free health services and preventive care to Maltese citizens. State hospitals and clinics are complemented by private hospitals, which have proliferated since the 1990s. Since 1988 the island of Malta has been home to the United Nations International Institute on Ageing (INIA), which has made the island a centre of geriatric care and research.In 1956 social insurance was introduced to cover employees, the self-employed, and unemployed persons. A comprehensive contributory insurance scheme was introduced in 1972, integrating a variety of earlier legislation. In 1979 this program was enhanced to introduce an earnings-related retirement pension. The 1994 Social Security Act consolidated earlier legislation and also incorporated noncontributory schemes. Until 1986 social security in Malta was administered through three separate laws: the Old Age Pensions Act of 1948, the National Assistance Act of 1956, and the National Insurance Act of 1956. In January 1987 these acts were consolidated into the Social Security Act.EducationFrom the early 1970s until the mid-1980s, the government  radically altered the education system, which was previously structured on British models and strongly influenced by the Roman Catholic Church. Compulsory education was extended to include all children ages 5 to 16. The streaming of students by age and intellectual ability and through examinations was at first discarded but later reintroduced. In 2005 Maltas government reformed the education system again and created autonomous regional colleges consisting of primary and secondary schools and junior colleges.At the tertiary level, a student-worker scheme was introduced in 1978, with students working for six months and studying for six months, thereby linking admission to higher educational institutions to the availability of employment. This system was largely revoked by the Education Act of 1988, and admission to institutions of higher learning is now based completely on competence.The University of Malta at Msida and the Malta College of Arts, Science, and Technology (MCAST) are the countrys principal institutions of higher education. The former was founded as a Jesuit college in 1592, established as a state institution in 1769, and refounded in 1988. It offers courses in most disciplines and has a prestigious medical school. Its modern campus at Tal-Qroqq also houses the International Maritime Law Institute and the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies. MCAST, founded in 2000, mainly offers vocational and technical education and has institutes on Malta and Gozo.Cultural lifeCultural milieuThe culture of Malta is reflected in a mixture of Arab and Italian traditions. The Maltese are highly literate and have a deep appreciation of the arts. The Italian painter Caravaggio and the Maltese poet Dun Karm are considered major contributors to art and literature in Malta. Maltas cultural influences stem largely from the countrys history of foreign domination and the influence of the Roman Catholic Church. Folk traditions have evolved mainly around the festa that celebrates the patron saint of a village, which is marked by processions and fireworks.Daily life and social customsAs a Roman Catholic country, Malta celebrates Good Friday with colourful processions in several villages. Mnarja, the Feast of St. Peter and St. Paul, takes place on the weekend preceding June 29 in Buskett Gardens in Rabat. It is the countrys principal folk festival and is highlighted by folksinging (gana) contests and fried-rabbit picnics. The annual Carnival is celebrated in various villages in Malta, but the main events take place in Valletta, where vigorous dancing displays that include the Parata, a sword dance commemorating the Maltese victory over the Turks in 1565, and Il-Maltija, the Maltese national dance, are performed. Independence Day is celebrated on September 21, and Republic Day is commemorated on December 13."},{"CountryName":"Mauritania","CulturalInfo":"Government and society Constitutional framework The Mauritanian state had a presidential regime from 1960 until 1978, when a coup dtat installed a military government. A civilian government established in December 1980 was replaced the following April by a largely military administration. In 1991 a new constitution established a multiparty system and a new bicameral legislative structure. Additional coups took place in 2005 and 2008, each followed by elections. Constitutional amendments to the 1991 constitution, put forth in 2006, included a new legislative body, an adjustment of the presidential term, and an age limit of 75 for presidential candidates. Following the 2008 coup, the military leadership announced that the 1991 constitution, augmented by a supplemental charter, would remain in place. Mauritania is a republic. The president, elected by popular vote for a five-year term, is head of state and government and is assisted by the prime minister, whom he appoints. Until 2017 Mauritania had a bicameral legislature made up of the Senate, the majority of whose members were elected by municipal leaders, and the National Assembly, whose members are elected by popular vote for five-year terms. In 2017, though, the Senate was abolished by a popular referendum, leaving the National Assembly as the sole chamber of the legislature. Local government The country is divided into administrative regions, each of which is directed by a governor. The capital forms a separate district. Justice Islamic law (Sharah) and Mlik jurisprudence have been in force since February 1980. Qadis (judges of the Sharah) in rural and settled communities hear cases relating to marriage, divorce, and other personal status issues. The High Council for Fatwa and Administrative Appeals issues opinions on Islamic law and examines complaints from citizens on both civil and legal disputes.. The judiciary also includes lower courts, labour and military courts, the Court of State Security, a Constitutional Council, a High Court of Justice, and a Supreme Court, the highest court of appeal, which deals with administrative as well as judicial matters. Political process Suffrage in Mauritania is universal for Mauritanian citizens age 18 and older, all of whom are permitted to hold office. A 2006 decree stipulated that one-fifth of political party positions be reserved for women; in addition, in September of that year two women were appointed as the countrys first female governors. Minorities also participate in the political process, though in general at a rate lower than their proportion of the wider population. Security The Mauritanian defense forces consist of an army, a navy, an air force, and a paramilitary. The army is by far the largest contingent. Military service is determined by authorized conscription and is two years in duration. Health and welfare Modern health facilities are scarce in Mauritania. There is a major hospital in Nouakchott and a number of other regional health centres, including maternity clinics. Free medical services are available to the poor. Traditional remedies for illnesssome of which are traced to classical Arabic texts, others based on the special skills of local bone-setters and herbalistscontinue to serve an important role. Among other health problems found in tropical areas, tuberculosis, venereal disease, and intestinal and eye maladies are present. Data on the impact of HIV/AIDS in Mauritania is imperfect, but the incidence appears to be modest by comparison with other regions of the continent. Education Primary schooling, which lasts for six years, begins at age six and is officially compulsory. Secondary education, which begins at age 12, lasts for seven yearsfour years in a lower cycle of studies followed by three years in an upper cycle. About half of the adult population is literate, although literacy rates for men are substantially higher than those for women. At the time of independence in 1960, the language of the educational system was French, and a majority of students came from the southern part of the country, mainly from the Tukulor and Wolof populations, where there was a tradition of French colonial schooling. As a result, Blacks in the country held most of the technical, professional, and diplomatic posts in the early 1960s, and the majority Arabic-speaking Moors felt themselves to be disadvantaged. In the late 1980s, however, the military government accelerated a policy of Arabization that led to Arabic being taught in four-fifths of schools a decade later. The University of Nouakchott (1981) has faculties of letters and human sciences and of law and economics. Other advanced education is provided by a research institute for mining and industry, a centre for Islamic studies, and a training facility for administrative personnel in Nouakchott.Cultural life The primary task of Mauritanias successive governments has been to unify a community of diverse ethnic groups that are hierarchical in social structure and very strongly differentiated. The religion shared by all ethnic groups in the country has served as a centripetal force in creating a national culture. Many of the local barriers to cooperation have been overcome, and traditional regional boundaries have been redrawn. Moorish women have long held central roles as household managers as well as critical cultural roles as the chief transmitters of Moorish culture, a tradition that has been translated into the modern economy with women playing an active part in government, business and education. Mauritania celebrates the feasts and holidays observed by other Muslim countries, such as Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha, which marks the culmination of the hajj. In addition to these, Labour Day is observed on May 1, Africa Day on May 25, and Independence Day on November 28. The arts Moorish society is proud of its nomadic past and its Arab and Muslim heritage and boasts of its appellation the land of a thousand poets within the Arab world. The composition and recitation of poetry, both in classical forms and in the assniyyah dialect, have traditionally been among the distinguishing marks of high culture in Saharan desert society. Traditional music forms, which still flourish, owe much to Andalusian instrumentation as well as sub-Saharan African motifs and are today increasingly fused with Middle Eastern music, due in part to the pervasive influence of television and radio transmissions from the Arab world. Many of the traditional forms of music and instrumentation are being eclipsed by contemporary musicians. Local Mauritanian recording stars include Dimi Mint Abba, Ouleya Mint Amar Tichit, and Malouma Mint Moktar Ould El Meiddah, better known simply as Malouma, who was elected to the Mauritanian senate in 2007. Within the Mauritanian film world, Med Hondo is one of the best-known artists, but Sidney Sokhona and Abderrahmane Sissako are also well-known names. Despite the flood of new cultural influences that have modified traditional practice, goldsmithing remains a fine art, and the work by local silversmiths is highly prized by Mauritanians as well as visitors. The trade in precious beads, which has medieval origins, is also valued. Cultural institutions Nouakchott is the site of a national library, national archives, and a national cultural and social research centre, which houses a repository for the national collection of Arabic manuscripts. There are numerous private local libraries in many urban centres that specialize in Arabic works; among these are the family libraries of Arabic manuscripts in Boutilimit, Chinguei, and Kadi. An open-access inventory of the contents of a number of these libraries is available on the Internet. Sports and recreation The Mauritanians game of choice is football (soccer), a sport that is well organized within the capital city of Nouakchott but less so in the countrys sparsely populated interior. As a result, the annual Mauritania Cup is almost always a contest among Nouakchott-area teams, many of them drawn from the military. A national stadium in the capital provides excellent facilities for visiting teams. Mauritania formed a national Olympic committee in 1962 and was recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1979. It made its first Olympic appearance in 1984 at the Los Angeles Games. Movie theatres are found in the main urban centres, and social sporting clubs provide recreational opportunities in Nouakchott, Noudhibou, and Rosso. Media and publishing Formerly owned or controlled by the government, the media are now relatively open, and a wide range of political and cultural publications are available in urban centres. Newspapers include Chaab, published in Arabic; the French-language Horizons; Al-Mourabit and Le Quotidien de Nouakchott, publications available on the Internet; Journal Officiel, a government journal published fortnightly; Al-Qalam (Le Calame), a weekly published in both Arabic and French; and others. Radio and television stations broadcast in Arabic, French, and a number of African languages.Charles Henri Toupet Alfred G. Gerteiny Charles C. Stewart "},{"CountryName":"Mauritius","CulturalInfo":" Resources, power, and manufacturing bagasseMauritius has few viable mineral resources. Basalt and lime are mined. Electricity is largely generated from imported petroleum, with a small percentage derived from hydropower. Sugar plantations often use bagassethe fibre that remains from sugarcane after sugar-bearing juice is extractedas fuel to produce electricity. There has been a steady increase in manufacturing since the 1970s. The Mauritius Export Processing Zone, which concentrates on labour-intensive processing of imported raw materials or semifinished goods for the export market, has successfully attracted foreign investment. Economically important manufactures include textiles, food processing, metal and metal products, and chemical products.   Finance and trade Mauritius is home to many financial institutions, including a development bank, offshore banking facilities, and several commercial banks. The Bank of Mauritius is the central bank and issues the countrys currency, the Mauritian rupee. The countrys stock exchange is located in Port Louis. Imports, largely of machinery and transport equipment, petroleum, and foodstuffs, outweigh exports of clothing and textiles, sugar, and fish and fish products. Important trading partners include the United Kingdom, France, the United States, South Africa, and China.   Services, labour, and taxation Significant growth in tourism since the 1970s has made it a major earner of foreign exchange. Information and communication technology is becoming increasing important. In 2001 the government created the Information and Communication Technologies Authority to promote and oversee the burgeoning sector. More than two-fifths of the labour force is employed in the areas of finance and services. Construction and manufacturing employ about one-third of the labour force, and about one-tenth is employed in the agricultural sector. Taxation is an important source of funding in Mauritius, accounting for about nine-tenths of the governments revenue. About half of the total tax revenue is derived from taxes on goods and services. Trade taxes account for about one-fifth; corporate income tax, about one-eighth.   Transportation and telecommunications Port Louis, MauritiusMauritius has a strong transportation infrastructure. The road system is well developed and in good repair, and almost all roadways are paved. Most of the countrys shipping activity is conducted through port facilities at Port Louis, which has been cultivated as a free port to encourage its development as an international shipping hub. An international airport is located at Plaisance, and there are other airports located throughout the country. Air Mauritius, the national carrier, flies many international routes. The island does not have any rail service. The countrys telecommunications sector is well developed and among the best in the region. There has been rapid progress in this area owing to the countrys growing information and communication technology industry. About three-fourths of the population has mobile phone service, and one-fourth has internet service.    Government and society  Constitutional framework Mauritius became independent on March 12, 1968. Under the constitution adopted that year, the country was a constitutional monarchy with the British monarch as head of state. In 1991 a constitutional amendment was passed providing for a republican form of government, with a president as head of state; the amendment went into effect in 1992. Legislative power is vested in a National Assembly, elected every five years and consisting of 62 elected members and up to an additional 8 members drawn from the pool of candidates who were not elected but who may be appointed to broaden representation among minorities or underrepresented parties. Executive power is exercised by a Council of Ministers headed by a prime minister (appointed by the president), who assembles a government from members of the National Assembly. The president and vice president are elected by the National Assembly for a term of five years.   Local government and justice Port MathurinHarbour at Port Mathurin, Rodrigues Island, Mauritius.(more)For administrative purposes, the island of Mauritius is divided into districts. The outlying territories of Agalega, Cargados Carajos Shoals, and Rodrigues Island each have dependency status. The Supreme Court is the highest judicial authority and includes courts of civil appeal and criminal appeal. There are also district courts.   Political process and security The constitution provides for universal suffrage for citizens 18 years and older. The political process in Mauritius is open to participation by minorities and women. Minority representation is enhanced by the policy of appointing additional members to the National Assembly to achieve ethnic balance. Although women have held legislative seats and cabinet positions, their numbers have been few. There are many political parties, but three large parties dominate Mauritian politics: the Mauritius Labour Party (MLP; Parti Travailliste [PTr]), the Mauritian Militant Movement (Mouvement Militant Mauricien; MMM), and the Militant Socialist Movement (Mouvement Socialiste Militant; MSM). The MLP and the MSM generally compete for the dominant Hindu vote, although they both have supporters in all communities. The MMM has its base in the minoritiesthe Creoles, Muslims, and non-Hindi-speaking Indian communities (especially the Tamils and Telugus)although it too has prominent Hindu supporters. Coalitions among parties are frequent. Mauritius does not maintain an active military force, although it does have a small paramilitary force that includes a coast guard unit. Despite some unrest, the country has, on the whole, seen political success: Since independence, Mauritius, unlike most African former colonies, has sustained an open, free, democratic, and highly competitive political system. Elections have been held on a regular basis with the losing parties giving way to the winners. Its limited military structure has meant that it has been spared the difficulty of military coups.   Health, welfare, and housing Since independence Mauritius has developed a substantial social welfare system that provides free basic health services to the entire population. Care is provided through a network of hospitals, dispensaries, family-planning facilities, and social welfare centres. Old age pensions, family allowances, and other measures for social protection are also provided. Overcrowding is prevalent in urban areas, and the government provides loans to local authorities for urban housing schemes.   Education Education is compulsory between ages 5 and 16. Six years of primary education begins at age 5, which is followed by up to seven years of secondary education. Primary and secondary education are free. The University of Mauritius (1965) has faculties of agriculture, engineering, law and management, science, and social studies and humanities. Other institutions of higher education include the University of Technology, Mauritius (2000). Some students attend universities in India, France, and the United Kingdom. More than four-fifths of the population is literate.    Cultural life Mauritius offers a rich mixture of the many cultures and traditions of its different peoples. The ethnic and religious diversity of Mauritius also means that there are many holidays and festivals scheduled throughout the year, including the Hindu festivals of Maha Shivaratree (see Mah-ivartr) in February and March and Divali in late October and November; the Muslim festival of d al-Fir, marking the end of Ramadan; the Catholic observances in honour of Pre Laval in September, All Saints Day in November, and Christmas in December; the lively Chinese Spring Festival celebration; and the Tamil holiday of Thaipoosam Cavadee, usually held in January or February, which includes fire-walking ceremonies. The entire country observes Abolition of Slavery Day on February 1, Republic Day on March 12, Labour Day on May 1, and Arrival of Indentured Laborers Day on November 2. "},{"CountryName":"Mexico","CulturalInfo":"Health and welfare There are pronounced differences in health conditions from region to region within Mexico. In general, rural areas have much higher mortality and morbidity levels than do urban areas. Regions with large indigenous populations, such as Chiapas, Oaxaca, and portions of Guerrero, as well as isolated mountainous sections of the Mesa Central, have especially low health standards and high death rates. There also are great differences in health conditions among social classes in cities. Poor and indigenous Mexicans tend to suffer from an inordinate share of illness associated with unsafe water supplies, infections, and respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis, as well as with physical violence. Generally speaking, the leading causes of death in Mexico are diseases of the circulatory system, diabetes mellitus, cancers, accidents and violence, and diseases of the digestive and respiratory systems. Federally subsidized medical and hospital care is available to all Mexican citizens. Several government institutions, including the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Security and Social Services Institute for Government Workers, operate hospitals. Public medicine, like public education, is considered inferior to private care, however, and those who can afford it avail themselves of private physicians and hospitals. Clinics, though sometimes attended only by a nurse, are found throughout the country. Anything more than the most basic medical needs, however, must be handled in the cities. The quality of medical service varies throughout the country, with Mexico City by far the principal centre for specialized treatment. The overall quality of medical care in Mexico lags behind that available in the United States and Europe, and many Mexicans travel outside the country for more-sophisticated surgical procedures or treatments. In spite of government efforts to extend health care to disadvantaged citizens, in rural areas and among poorer families, modern medicine is often considered too expensive or difficult to obtain, or it is not trusted. In many cases curanderos (traditional healers) or shamans are sought for their knowledge of curative herbs and other folk remedies. Hot springs and saunalike sweat baths are used in some indigenous communities. Housing A lack of adequate housing is one of Mexicos most serious problems. Within the cities the federal government has built multiunit housing projects, but urban populations have increased more rapidly than new units can be constructed, and economic difficulties have reduced the funds available for new construction. Although substandard housing is more visible in urban areas, living conditions are also unhealthful in some rural areas. In virtually all urban areas, peripheral squatter settlements are a major feature of the landscape. Rural migrants, as well as members of the urban underclass, build makeshift housing, often of used or discarded materials, on unoccupied lands at the edges of cities. These colonias initially lack the most basic urban services (water, electricity, sewerage), but most evolve over time into very modest but livable communities. Education Mexico has made significant efforts to improve educational opportunities for its people. School attendance is required for children ages 6 to 18, and since 2004 preschool has been mandatory as well. In addition to increasing the number of schools for children, adult literacy programs have been promoted vigorously since the 1970s. By the turn of the 21st century it was estimated that about nine-tenths of Mexicans were literate, up nearly 20 percent since 1970. Public schools in Mexico are funded by the federal government. Although nearly three-fourths of all primary public schools are located in rural areas, such schools are the poorest in the country and often do not cover the primary cycle. Many internal migrants move to cities because of the availability of better schools for their children and the social opportunities that derive from an education. In rural areas as well as in many low-income urban areas, teachers need only a secondary education to be certified to teach. Despite increases in the numbers of schoolrooms, teachers, and educational supplies, about one-seventh of all school-age children do not attend school, and almost one-third of adults have not completed primary school. Nevertheless, nearly half of the Mexican population has completed a secondary (high school) degree, though secondary schools are virtually nonexistent in rural areas. As with primary education, private secondary schools are considered vastly superior to public ones, and families who can afford it send their children to private schools. This contributes to the socioeconomic imbalance that greatly favours the middle and upper classes. Library of the National Autonomous University of MexicoLibrary of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, with mosaics by Juan OGorman, 195153.(more)Universities are found only in the largest cities. Moreover, of the more than 50 universities in the country, one-fifth are located in Mexico City, and a high proportion of all university students study there. The National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autnoma de Mxico; UNAM), the College of Mexico, and the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education are among the most prestigious institutions of higher education in the country. Although two million university students are enrolled in courses every year, less than one-eighth of the population has a tertiary degree.Cultural life Cultural milieu Mexican society is ethnically and regionally diverse, and there are sharp socioeconomic divisions within the population. Many rural communities maintain strong allegiances to regions, often referred to as patrias chicas (small homelands), which help to perpetuate cultural diversity. The large number of indigenous languages and customs, especially in the south, also accentuates cultural differences. However, indigenismo, or pride in the indigenous heritage, has been a major unifying theme of the country since the 1930s. In attempts to unite the country culturally by identifying a uniquely Mexican culture, the government has sometimes supported indigenous folk arts and crafts as well as the European-inspired classical arts. "},{"CountryName":"Moldova","CulturalInfo":"Government and society Constitutional framework A new constitution, which replaced the 1978 document that had provided for a Soviet-style government structure, was approved by the Moldovan parliament in July 1994 and promulgated on August 27 of that year. Describing the republic as a sovereign, independent state in which justice and political pluralism are guaranteed, this constitution formally established a unicameral parliament whose members are directly elected to four-year terms. By secret ballot they elect the president, who serves as the head of state, to a four-year term. The president shares executive power with the Council of Ministers (cabinet), which is led by the prime minister, who is designated by the president (after consultation with the parliamentary majority) and approved by the parliament. The council is responsible for implementing the domestic and foreign policy of the state. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Gagauz in the south and Russians east of the Dniester River declared their own independent republics. The Moldovan government addressed the desires of the Gagauz in January 1995 by establishing an autonomous administrative region known as Gguzia. Its capital is in Comrat, where a governor (bakan), an executive committee, and a legislature sit (foreign policy, defense, and monetary issues in Gguzia are still under the control of the Moldovan government). Neither the Moldovan government nor the international community has recognized the independent republic of Transdniestria (Pridnestrovie; Transnistria), whose name is derived from its location beyond (on the eastern side of) the Dniester River. Under Transdniestrias constitution its president also serves as prime minister, and there is a unicameral legislature. The self-proclaimed republic also has its own flag and anthem. In response to the regions aspirations, the 1994 Moldovan constitution had authorized special status for the semiautonomous territory of Transdniestria, as it had for Gguzia. This offer was rejected by Transdniestrias government, and an overwhelming majority of Transdniestrian residents voted for independence in a 2006 referendum (though the subsequent declaration of independence was not recognized elsewhere). Russia maintained a force of some 1,500 troops in Transdniestria. Local government Tiraspol, MoldovaTown hall, Tiraspol, Moldova.(more)Following Soviet rule, Moldova was reorganized into jude (counties), the municipality of Chiinu, and the autonomous region of Gguzia. In 2003 the country was restructured again, with previous divisions replaced by raione (districts), municipii (municipalities; including Chiinu), and Gguzia. At a more local level, Moldova is administered by elected town and village councils and mayors; their activities are coordinated by district councils, which also are elected. Justice The judicial system comprises the Supreme Court of Justice (with members appointed by the parliament), a Court of Appeal, and lower courts (whose members are appointed by the president). The Higher Magistrates Council nominates judges and oversees their transfer and promotion. Political process The Communist Party of Moldaviauntil 1990 the only legal partywas dissolved in 1991 but was legalized as the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (Partidul Comunitilor din Republica Moldova; PCRM) in 1994. Following independence a variety of political parties emerged, many of them later to divide or to merge with other parties or coalitions. Some of these parties are based on ethnicity (including the Gagauz Peoples Party) and advocacy of independence or unification with either Romania or Russia. A national referendum on Moldovas status as an independent country was held on March 6, 1994, with a large turnout of eligible voters. More than 95 percent voted in favour of continued independence. Moldovans aged 18 or older are eligible to vote in elections. In elections in the 1990s and early 2000s, about three-fifths of eligible voters cast ballots. Health and welfare Since the mid-1990s the quality and availability of health care in Moldova have improved. In 1991 the Moldovan government established social service programs to supplement the monthly income of the average citizen during the transition from a command to a market economy. These programs were designed to preserve and strengthen the social safety net put in place during the Soviet period. The Social Assistance Fund supplies the needy with medical payments and housing and food subsidies. The Social Security Fund provides pensions for workers, invalids, and soldiers, assists workers during illness or temporary disability, and aids the unemployed. Education Significant changes occurred in Moldovan society during the Soviet era. Illiteracy was eradicated, and, as in other Soviet republics, emphasis was placed on technical education in order to satisfy the steadily growing needs of agriculture and industry for specialists and a highly skilled workforce. Before 1940 the republic had only a few institutions of higher education and teacher-training colleges, as well as a theological seminary and an agricultural institute. Since then several institutions of higher education and numerous specialized middle schools have been established. Notable universities include the Moldovan State Agrarian University (founded in 1933 as an offshoot of the agriculture department of the University of Iai), the Moldova State University (1946), and the Technical University of Moldova (1964). They all provide instruction in Romanian and Russian, and since the early 1990s the Moldovan language has increasingly been introduced into the educational system. A vigorous program of Moldovan instruction in primary and secondary schools was implemented in 2000. The Moldova Academy of Sciences, established in Chiinu in 1946, coordinates the activities of scientific institutions. In addition, dozens of research centres in the fields of viticulture, horticulture, beet growing, grain cultivation, and wine making have been set up, and Moldovan scientists have won international acclaim in these fields.Cultural life Cultural milieu The historical ties between Bessarabia and Romania and the ethnic kinship of Moldovans and Romanians are still reflected in the culture of Moldova. The development of Moldovan culture after World War II, however, followed the prevailing pattern of the Soviet Union as a whole. The state assumed responsibility for the content and direction of all cultural and intellectual life. The theatre, motion pictures, television, and printed matter were subject to censorship and close ideological scrutiny. Until the waning days of Soviet influence, private initiative in cultural endeavours was rare. Daily life and social customs As a mainly Eastern Orthodox country, Moldova celebrates Christian holidays. Its various ethnic groups tend to follow the customs and eat the foods of their own nationality. Moldovas Independence Day, August 27, commemorates the countrys breakaway from the Soviet Union (an event that is not celebrated in Transdniestria, which has retained many Soviet holidays and symbols of Soviet life). Moldovans observe a calendar of planting and harvest fairs that feature traditional dancing, singing, and folk arts. The village of Ivancho, near Chiinu, is a centre for these traditional cultural activities, as is the Orheiul Vechi, a restored monastery near the capital. Chiinu remains a musical centre, boasting dozens of nightclubs, discotheques, and concert halls. The arts Notable Moldovan artists include painters Mihail Petrik, Valentin Coreachin, and Vitaly Tiseev and sculptors Iury Kanashin and Vladimir Moraru. Moldova was known in the Soviet era for the quality of its musical instruction, with many Russian composers and conductors serving on the faculty of Chiinus Academy of Music. One of the academys graduates is the internationally known composer Arkady Luxemburg. Moldovans have also embraced contemporary styles such as rock, pop, and hip-hop, and Moldova has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since 2005. Moldovan literature experienced the vicissitudes of Soviet literature generally during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Building socialism and creating the new Soviet citizen were the dominant themes, and socialist goals prevailed over aesthetic considerations. Characteristic of these trends were the early prose and poetry of Emilian Bucov and Andrei Lupan, who followed the principles of Socialist Realism; later they and younger writers diversified their techniques and subject matter. Perhaps the most outstanding modern writer is the dramatist and novelist Ion Drua. His novel Balade de cmpie (1963; Ballads of the Steppes), an investigation of the psychology of the village, marked a significant turning point in the evolution of Moldovan fiction, and his play Casa Mare (1962; The Parlour) turned away from the concept of collectivity to probe the individual conscience. The work of contemporary essayist and novelist Vitalie Ciobanu is well known in Moldova. Cultural institutions Chiinu, Moldova: bell towerA bell tower in the centre of Chiinu, Moldova.(more)Most of the countrys theatres, museums, music halls, and libraries are in Chiinu. The most significant museums are the National Museum of Fine Arts of Moldova and the National History Museum of Moldova. During the period of Soviet rule, the state gave particular attention to the expansion of cultural opportunities. Numerous amateur theatres and musical and art groups were supported. The state also attempted to preserve the rich heritage of Moldovan folk art and music through such ensembles as the Doina choir and Zhok popular ballet and through local and national museums. Economic changes and urbanization, however, undermined traditional society and curtailed artistic creativity. Moreover, the economic deprivations and hardships since independence have left the average Moldovan little time for cultural interests, and the national budget deficits have left few governmental resources with which to subsidize cultural activities. In 2015 Moldova joined Creative Europe, an EU program designed to support the efforts of creative and cultural organizations with increased access to funding, training, and networking opportunities. Sports and recreation Moldovans are avid football (soccer) fans. Games are played throughout the country by organized local teams that compete each year for the national Moldovan Cup. Wrestling has become significant, made popular by Moldovan world champion Lukman Jabrailov. Judo, archery, and athletics (track and field) are also popular. Other favourite sports are rugby, tennis, martial arts, cycling, boxing, volleyball, and canoeing. Chess is a common pastime. In past years ethnic Moldovans have competed on the Olympic teams of both the Soviet Union and Romania. At the 1992 Games in Barcelona, the country participated as part of the Unified Team. Moldova competed for the first time as an independent country at the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, Norway. Because Moldova lacks both mountains and a seashore, many recreational opportunities are limited. Media and publishing The 1994 Moldovan constitution protects freedom of expression in the press; nevertheless, Moldovan media have received widespread criticism for being overly influenced by the government, and there have been occasional incidents of politically motivated prosecution of journalists. There has been concern that Chiinu-based publications that question Moldovas independence or promote Transdniestrias separatist policies will be subject to censorship. The initial outpouring of publications at the time of independence has been considerably reduced in the years since, largely as a result of economic pressures. Most publications that started as dailies have cut back production schedules. Notable existing dailies, all published in Chiinu, are the government organ Moldova Suveren (Sovereign Moldova), Nezavisimaya Moldova (Independent Moldova), and the Romanian-language Flux. The national news agency, known by its acronym Moldpres, is the countrys official news service. All broadcasting activities have been consolidated under the State Radio and Television Company of Moldova, which was founded in 1994. Fyodor Nikolayevich Sukhopara Ernest Latham"},{"CountryName":"Mongolia","CulturalInfo":"Health and welfare Before the 1920s Mongolians had no medical services other than what was provided by the lamas, who employed herbal medicines and prayers for recovery from illness. Public and personal hygiene were extremely poor, diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis were widespread, and the population was in decline. During the socialist period Soviet doctors introduced modern Western medical practices and equipment and taught basic health care. The first teaching hospitals, clinics, and maternity homes were built in Ulaanbaatar. Medical treatment, paid for by the government, was free for patients. The political and economic changes in the early 1990s left Mongolias health care system scrambling for funding. A national health insurance plan was introduced in 1994, and legislation subsequently was enacted to transform the state-run health care system and develop private health care. Many private-care plans are now available, mainly in Ulaanbaatar. Medical training was improved, and private hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and family doctor surgeries were opened. In addition, donor countries built modern hospitals. As a result, infant mortality rates fell dramatically, and overall death rates declined as well before both stabilized. Mongolia has a sophisticated social welfare system, funded by a combination of contributory social insurance and subsidies from the state budget. There is a range of assistance payments for child care, one-parent families, various disabilities, and state old-age pensions. Towns have employment agencies, and registered unemployed (those who have previously worked) can receive modest support. The unregistered unemployed include such groups as recent school graduates, former soldiers, and released prisoners. The government strictly controls the organized immigration of foreign workers, while rising numbers of Mongolians seek employment abroad, mainly in South Korea. Education In the prerevolutionary period, boys could be taught in monasteries to read and write in Mongolian and Tibetan or trained for secretarial work in the local administrative seal offices (so-named for the local rulers seals of authority kept in them). After 1921 Mongolia began building its first public schools, which started providing free education for all who attended them. The main thrust at first was directed at eradicating illiteracy and creating a trained intelligentsia. From 1940 on, however, the emphasis passed to expanding elementary and secondary facilities throughout the country and to establishing the first institution of higher education, the Mongolian State University, founded in 1942 (also called the National University of Mongolia). An important measure was the creation of boarding schools for the children of nomadic herding families. The funding for all these ventures came from the state budget, supplemented by Soviet aid subsidies. The Soviets also provided teacher training in the Soviet Union. There are now hundreds of general schools that offer primary and secondary education, dozens of special vocational schools, about a dozen universities, and some hundred colleges. Education is compulsory for 11 years, beginning at age 6; a growing number of schools have instituted 12 years of mandatory education. In addition to the thousands of Mongolian students at the countrys institutions of higher education, hundreds also study in Russia as well as in the United States, Great Britain, China, and other countries. The Academy of Sciences, founded in its present form in 1961 from earlier scholarly institutions, coordinates research across a wide range of scientific establishments including the Academies of Agricultural and Medical Sciences. There are several other institutions not subordinate to the Academy of Sciences, including the Defense and Police Academies, which are training schools, and the government-operated Academy of Management.Cultural life Mongolia: horse raceHorse race during a naadam festival in Mongolia.(more)Contemporary cultural life in Mongolia is a unique amalgam of traditional nomadic, shamanic, and Buddhist beliefsnow free from the Marxist doctrine overlaid during the socialist period but vulnerable to powerful new foreign influences. Once-despised commercialism has come to drive national prosperity at the risk of harming the national heritage and environment. Images of Genghis Khan, the revered symbol of Mongol nationhood, now are used to advertise vodka and beer. Cultural affairs fall within the purview of the directorate in charge of culture and art within the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science. The government pursues cultural policies, funding the arts in the name of the national interest. However, the life support provided during the socialist period by the ruling party for compliant writers, artists, and musicians no longer exists, and those groups have formed associationssuch as the Arts Council and the Union of Art Workersto represent their interests. "},{"CountryName":"Montenegro","CulturalInfo":"Government and society Government Montenegro is a parliamentary republic that gained full independence from Serbia in June 2006, following a referendum in May in which just over the required 55 percent of Montenegrins voted to secede from the federation. In 2007 Montenegros parliament adopted the countrys first constitution. Montenegro is governed by independent executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The president is the head of state, elected directly for a period of five years. The unicameral parliament of Montenegro is led by a prime minister. Its judicial branch includes a constitutional court composed of five judges with nine-year terms and a supreme court with justices that have life terms. Local government Montenegros local government has 20 communes that range in size from about 18 to more than 770 square miles (50 to 2,000 square km) and in population from 5,000 to more than 130,000. Security In August 2006, just two months after declaring independence from Serbia, Montenegro formally abolished conscription and transitioned to a fully professional military. The country maintains an army, navy, and air force, and all three branches are open to both men and women. In the second decade of the 21st century, women represented almost 10 percent of active-duty service members and more than 40 percent of reservists and auxiliaries. At that time, Montenegros military consisted of roughly 2,000 active-duty troops, with the army accounting for roughly three-fourths of that number. This total was bolstered by approximately 4,000 special police personnel and some 6,000 security officers from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In June 2017 Montenegro became the 29th member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Education Eight years of primary education are compulsory in Montenegro, beginning at age seven. Four years of secondary education also are available, divided between two types of schools: general secondary schools, which prepare students for universities; and vocational schools, which offer training that usually leads to admission to two-year technical colleges. The University of Montenegro, located in Podgorica, was founded in 1974.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tBritannica Quiz\t\tGeography Fun Facts\t\nCultural life Daily life and social customs Montenegros traditional culture revolves around clans, groups of patrilineally related families that at one time maintained tribal identities on their own traditional territories. Increasing integration into the Yugoslav state, including general provision of public education, brought an end to clan autonomy, but clans themselves remain an important element in Montenegrin social life. A continuing object of complaint has been rampant clan nepotism in the staffing of governmental bureaucracies. Faced with incessant threats from Ottoman armies and rival groups, clans traditionally emphasized personal courage in combat as a major virtue. This was reflected in the disproportionate role, before the republican secessions of the early 1990s, of Montenegrins in Yugoslavias armed forces. Montenegrins constituted a high proportion of noncommissioned and commissioned officers in the Yugoslav Peoples Army, including about one-fifth of its generals. Another factor explaining this influence is the limited economic opportunities available in Montenegro itself. The arts Montenegro is perhaps best known to the outside world for its rich architectural heritage and medieval murals. Among the most notable structures are the Romanesque cathedral of St. Tryphon in Kotor, the 16th-century Husein-Pasha Mosque in Pljevlja, and the Baroque church of Our Lady of the Rocks on an islet in the Bay of Kotor. This region was recognized in 1979 by UNESCO as a World Heritage site. The old town of Budva was of particular importance until it was destroyed in an earthquake in 1979; since rebuilt, it now serves as a beach resort and amusement park. Montenegros medieval murals date back to the 10th century. A 13th-century mural depicting the life of St. Elias, located in the Moraca monastery, is perhaps most notable. In subsequent centuries, Montenegrin artists sometimes showed the influence of western European styles such as the Baroque, but traditional art forms such as icon painting, wood carving, and textile weaving also continued unabated. By the turn of the 20th century, western European stylesgenerally inherited many years after their popularity in artistic capitals such as Parisbegan to dominate. At mid-century Milo Milunovi used aspects of Post-Impressionist technique to depict the landscape of Montenegro, while in the postwar period Petar Lubarda used Expressionist techniques to portray his homeland. In the late 20th century a younger generation of artists blended international trends and styles with Montenegrin imagery and political concerns. Beginning in the 1990s, new forums for exhibition, such as the Montenegro Cetinje Biennial, allowed work by Montenegrin artists to be seen by an increasingly large number of people. Montenegrin literature has its roots in folk literature sung to the accompaniment of the gusla (a type of folk fiddle). As elsewhere in Europe, monasteries were the centres of literacy and, not surprisingly, religious leaders produced the first written works. Early manuscripts include Miroslavljevo jevandjelje (118690; Miroslavs Gospel), transcribed from an earlier Macedonian text. Only a 17th-century Latin-language copy remains of the first written work of Montenegrin literature, Kraljevstvo Slovena (117789; The Kingdom of the Slavs), by Pop (Father) Dukljanin of Bar.   Thirty-eight years after Johannes Gutenbergs invention (in 1494), the first state-owned printing press was established in Cetinje. In that year the Ostoih (Book of Psalms) was printed; it is believed to be the first book printed in Cyrillic from the South Slavic region. Without question the greatest poet of the region is Petar Petrovi Njego (Peter II), who also is celebrated widely among Serbs. Music too has an ancient history in Montenegro. A bone whistle from the Paleolithic Period (Old Stone Age) found in what is now Montenegro is the oldest musical instrument in all of Europe. Early church chants, as well as a number of organs built in the coastal region, testify to a lively tradition of church music. The above-mentioned Miroslavljevo jevandjelje gives the Old Slavic names of traveling musicians. Significant contemporary composers include Borislav Taminjzic (193392) and Zarko Mirkovic. Along the Montenegrin coast there are several annual arts festivals each summer that cater to tourists. Perhaps most significant is a theatre festival in Budva. The Montenegrin National Theatre, with a recently enlarged and renovated building, operates in Podgorica. Cultural institutions Despite a relatively small population, Montenegro has developed a wide range of cultural institutions. These include theatres, art galleries, museums, and libraries, as well as an independent Academy of Arts and Sciences. Cetinje, the historical capital of Montenegro, boasts many historic buildings, including the five-complex National Museum of Montenegro, which maintains separate art, ethnographic, and historical museums. The city is also home to the Cetinje Monastery, which is the repository of an important collection of medieval manuscripts. The archives in Kotor contain historical documents that are of interest to researchers. There are also museums of note in Perast and Herceg Novi. Niki and Podgorica both house well-stocked art galleries, each of which is located in a historic castle. Sports and recreation The government emphasizes physical education and sports. Fishing and hunting are popular. The state also has set aside substantial areas for recreation, including three national parks: Durmitor, Biogradska Gora, and Loven. Durmitor National Park was named a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1980. Media and publishing Scores of newspapers, including Pobjeda (Victory), are published in Montenegro. Local presses publish a few hundred books each year. There are several radio stations and a television studio and transmitter in the country.Thomas M. Poulsen The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica "},{"CountryName":"Morocco","CulturalInfo":" Education of MoroccoMorocco allocates approximately one-fifth of its budget to education. Much of this is spent on building schools to accommodate the rapidly growing population. Education is mandatory for children between the ages of 6 and 15 years. In urban areas the majority of children in this age group attend school, though on a national scale the level of participation drops significantly. About three-fourths of school-age males attend school, but only about half of school-age girls; these proportions drop markedly in rural areas. Slightly more than half of the children go on to secondary education, including trade and technical schools. Of these, few seek higher education. Poor school attendance, particularly in rural areas, has meant a low rate of literacy, which is about two-fifths of the population. Morocco has more than four dozen universities, institutes of higher learning, and polytechnics dispersed at urban centres throughout the country. Its leading institutions include Muammad V University in Rabat, the countrys largest university, with branches in Casablanca and Fs; the Hassan II Agriculture and Veterinary Institute in Rabat, which conducts leading social science research in addition to its agricultural specialties; and Al-Akhawayn University in Ifrane, a public English-language university inaugurated in 1995 with contributions from Saudi Arabia and the United States.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu The area that is now Morocco has long been a crossroads between Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East, and diverse cultural and ethnic groups have migrated through the region and left their mark on it. Beginning in the 8th century, indigenous Amazigh culture was met with waves of Arab conquerors and travelers who brought with them the Islamic faith and the powerful influence of Arabic language and culture. The arrival of numerous Jewish and Muslim refugees from the Spanish Reconquista beginning in the 16th century left Moroccan culture with a lasting Andalusian quality, and starting in the 19th century, the influence of French culture began to growalongside French political powerin all parts of North Africa. French culturealong with the persistence of the French languagehas continued to exert a strong influence on Morocco. Some Moroccans have also renewed their interest in Amazigh culture, and civic associations have been formed to encourage the study of Tamazight literature and oral traditions.   Daily life and social customs Marrakech, Morocco: Jamaa el-FnaJamaa el-Fna marketplace at night in Marrakech, Morocco.(more)Social life for most Moroccans still centres on home and family. The sidewalk caf is a favourite gathering place for men, and watching a football (soccer) match on television in the local caf is a popular form of entertainment. Big cities such as Casablanca boast a variety of diversions, including cinemas, restaurants, and shopping in modern boutiques or in the souk, the open-air market in which vendors sell a wide array of local arts and crafts items alongside foods and imported commodities. Moroccos extensive coastline has numerous fine beaches, some of them private and off-limits but many of them open to the public and within easy reach of the city. On weekends families often spend the day at the shore, swimming, picnicking, and playing sports. Moroccan cuisine has gained a following among connoisseurs worldwide, and the countrys rich agricultural regions provide ample products for Moroccan kitchens. Meat staples include fish, lamb, and fowlincluding pigeon, which is considered a delicacy when baked in pastry, the bstillah, a national favourite. Tomatoes, peppers, onions, and eggplants are among the numerous vegetables typically used in dishes, and fruits of all varieties are enjoyed. Bread is, as in all countries of the Middle East and North Africa, a deep cultural symbol as well as a daily staple. The premier Moroccan food, however, is couscous, a semolina-based pasta served with a meat stew. Kabobs of various types are common, as are salads and soups. Harira, a thick and hearty lamb soup, is served to break the fast at Ramadan and is a national speciality. The national drink is mint tea. Morocco is a wine-producing country, but production had begun to decline by the early 21st century under religious pressure that viewed alcohol consumption as inappropriate. Moroccans observe a number of secular and religious holidays. Islamic holidays include the two ds, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and the Prophets birthday (mawlid); national holidays include Independence Day and the kings birthday.   The arts The production of Moroccan literature has continued to grow and diversify. To the traditional genrespoetry, essays, and historiographyhave been added forms inspired by Middle Eastern and Western literary models. French is often used in publishing research in the social and natural sciences, and in the fields of literature and literary studies, works are published in both Arabic and French. Moroccan writers, such as Mohammed Choukri, Driss Chrabi, Abdallah Laroui, Abdelfattah Kilito, and Fatima Mernissi, publish their works in both French and English. Expatriate writers such as Pierre Loti, William S. Burroughs, and Paul Bowles have drawn attention to Moroccan writers as well as to the country itself. Since independence a veritable blossoming has taken place in painting and sculpture, popular music, amateur theatre, and filmmaking. The Moroccan National Theatre (founded 1956) offers regular productions of Moroccan and French dramatic works. Art and music festivals take place throughout the country during the summer months, among them the World Sacred Music Festival at Fs. Moroccan music, influenced by Arab, Amazigh, African, and Spanish traditions, makes use of a number of traditional instruments, such as the flute (ny), shawm (ghaita), zither (qann), and various short necked lutes (including the d and gimbr). These are often backed by explosive percussion on the darbkka (terra-cotta drum). Among the most popular traditional Moroccan artists internationally are the Master Musicians of Jajouka, an all-male guild trained from childhood, and Hassan Hakmoun, a master of gnwa trance music, a popular spiritual style that traces its roots to sub-Saharan Africa. Younger Moroccans enjoy ra, a style of plain-speaking Algerian music that incorporates traditional sounds with those of Western rock, Jamaican reggae, and Egyptian and Moroccan popular music.   Cultural institutions Morocco has a number of fine museums situated throughout the country. The Batha Museum, located in Fs and housed in a former 19th-century royal residence, specializes in historical Moroccan art and has an excellent collection of native ceramics. The Oudaa Museum (founded 1915; also known as the Museum of Moroccan Art) is located near Rabats Oudaa Casbah. Originally constructed as a private residence in the 17th century, the museum has collections of premodern Moroccan arts and crafts, as does the Dar El-Jama Museum (1920), which is located in Mekns. Rabats Archaeological Museum (1931) has a comprehensive collection covering the entirety of Moroccos history. Morocco is also home to a number of learned societies, research institutes, and archives.   Sports and recreation Spectator sports in Morocco traditionally centred on the art of horsemanship until European sportsfootball (soccer), polo, swimming, and tenniswere introduced at the end of the 19th century. Football is the countrys premier sport, popular among the urban youth in particular, and in 1970 Morocco became the first African country to play in World Cup competition. At the 1984 Olympic Games, two Moroccans won gold medals in track and field events, one of whomNawal El Moutawakel in the 400 metre hurdleswas the first woman from an Arab or Islamic country to win an Olympic gold medal. Tennis and golf have also become popular. Several Moroccan professional players have competed in international competition, and the country fielded its first Davis Cup team in 1999.   Media and publishing Moroccos government-owned radio and television network, Radiodiffusion Tlvision Marocaine (RTM), broadcasts throughout the country. Radio broadcasts are in Arabic, French, Tamazight, Spanish, and English, while television is broadcast in Arabic, Tamazight, and French. In addition, a private television network is headquartered in Casablanca and a private radio network in Tangier. There are about a dozen daily newspapers in Morocco, published in Rabat, Casablanca, and Tangier and written in both French and Arabic. Most are organs of political parties, whereas the remainder are owned by or sympathetic to the government. In addition, a rich variety of periodicals represent various professions, trades, intellectual interests, and avocations. The high rate of illiteracy, however, keeps readership low and makes television the primary medium for disseminating news and information. Abdallah Laroui Will D. Swearingen Susan Gilson Miller   History  This discussion focuses on Morocco since the 16th century. For a more-detailed treatment of earlier periods and of the country in its regional context, see North Africa.  Situated in the northwest corner of Africa and, on a clear day, visible from the Spanish coast, Morocco has resisted outside invasion while serving as a meeting point for European, Eastern, and African civilizations throughout history. Many of its early inhabitants, the Imazighen (Berbers), had adopted Christianity or Judaism, which were introduced during a brief period of Roman rule. In the late 7th century, Arab invaders from the East brought Islam, which the Imazighen gradually assimilated. Sunni Islam triumphed over various sectarian tendencies in the 12th and 13th centuries under the doctrinally rigorous Almohad dynasty. The Christian Reconquest of Spain in the later Middle Ages brought waves of Muslim and Jewish exiles from Spain to Morocco, injecting a Hispanic flavour into Moroccan urban life. Apart from some isolated coastal enclaves, however, Europeans failed to establish a permanent foothold in the area. In the 16th century, Ottoman invaders from Algeria attempted to add Morocco to their empire, thus threatening the countrys independence. They, too, were thwarted, leaving Morocco virtually the only Arab country never to experience Ottoman rule. In 1578, three kings fought and died near Ksar el-Kebir (Alcazarquivir), including the Portuguese monarch Sebastian. This decisive battle, known as the Battle of the Three Kings, was claimed as a Moroccan victory and put an end to European incursions onto Moroccan soil for three centuries. The 17th century saw the rise of the Alawite dynasty of sharifs, who still rule Morocco today. This dynasty fostered trade and cultural relations with sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and the Arab lands, though religious tensions between Islam and Christendom often threatened the peace. By the late 17th century, Moroccos cultural and political identity as an Islamic monarchy was firmly established. The figure of the strong sultan was personified by Mawly Isml (16721727), who used a slave army, known as the Abd al-Bukhr, to subdue all parts of the country and establish centralized rule. Subsequent monarchs often used their prestige as religious leaders to contain internal conflicts caused by competition among tribes. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when Europe was preoccupied with revolution and continental war, Morocco withdrew into a period of isolation. On the eve of the modern era, despite their geographic proximity, Moroccans and Europeans knew little about each other. "},{"CountryName":"Mozambique","CulturalInfo":"Education of MozambiqueThe Portuguese educational system was two-tiereddesigned to promote rudimentary skills among the majority African population and to provide liberal and technical education for the settler population and a tiny minority of Africans. More than four-fifths of students enrolled in the colonial system were restricted to the rudimentary program. The state, in cooperation with the Roman Catholic Church, provided public education, but private education was also available, mostly through church groups. The language of instruction was Portuguese, but at independence only a tiny proportion of the African population was literate in it. There were also Islamic schools in the capital and along the northern coast.The National System of Education, implemented in the early 1980s, created programs for people of all ages, part-time as well as full-time students, to improve both literacy and technical education. Private and parochial school facilities were nationalized to facilitate the reorganization and unification of the educational system. Although the number of primary, secondary, adult educational, and vocational centres increased rapidly, demand for education quickly outstripped the states capacity. Primary school attendance in 1973 was 643,000 and rose to about 1,500,000 by 1979. The figure declined in the 1980s, however, as Renamo destroyed more than 1,000 schools, but by the mid-1990s attendance was again approaching the 1979 level. Literacy increased considerably in the two decades after independenceto some two-fifths of the populationalthough the figure for males was more than double that for females. Frelimos Office of Mass Communications also utilized radio, murals, and a cartoon character (who represented the former colonial secret police) to disseminate information to the illiterate and promote communication among them.The national university, established in 1962 and renamed Eduardo Mondlane University in 1976 for the first president of Frelimo, offers courses through a range of faculties, centres, and schools. Other universities include the Catholic University of Mozambique (1995) and Higher Polytechnic and University Institute (1994), both of which have branches in multiple cities.Cultural lifeMozambique exhibits a great range of cultural and linguistic diversity, sharing cultural traditions with its neighbours in Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. Amid the variety of languages, social relationships, artistic traditions, clothing, and ornamentation patterns is a common theme of dynamic and creative cultural expression in song, oral poetry, dance, and performance. The carved wooden sculpture and mapiko initiation masks of the Makonde people of northern Mozambique and Tanzania are among the best-known artistic traditions."},{"CountryName":"Myanmar","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life Teaching BuddhaFresco of the Teaching Buddha at the Gubyaukgyi temple, 12th century, Pagan, Myanmar.(more)Buddhism has been a part of Myanmars culture since the 1st century ce and has blended with non-Buddhist beliefs. The most conspicuous manifestation of Buddhist culture is the magnificent architecture and sculpture of Myanmars many temples and monasteries, notably those at Yangon, Mandalay, and Pagan (Bagan), the site of the ancient kingdom of west-central Myanmar. Myanmars culture also is an amalgam of royal and common traditions. Although the dramatic traditions of the Burman court might have appeared to be dying after the elimination of the monarchy in the late 19th century, the tradition survived in a nonroyal context, among the masses. With the growth of nationalism and the regaining of independence, it gathered new strength. The most popular dramatic form is the pwe, which is performed outdoors. There are a variety of pwe genres, including both human and puppet theatre, and most draw subject matter from the Jataka talesstories of the former lives of the Buddha. Music and dance are integral to most dramatic forms of the Burmans. The various pwe are accompanied by music of the hsaing waing, a percussive instrumental ensemble with close relatives in neighbouring countries of mainland Southeast Asia. The leading instruments in the hsaing waing include a circle of 21 tuned drums called pat waing, an oboelike hne, a circle of small, horizontally suspended tuned gongs known as kyi waing, and another set of small gongs called maung hsaing. These instruments are supported melodically by other gongs and drums, while a wooden block and a pair of cymbals set the tempo and reinforce the musical structure. Dance styles that are accompanied by hsaing waing are derived in partand indirectlyfrom southern India. Much of the Burman dance tradition was adapted from the styles of Thailand and other Indianized (or formerly Indianized) states of Southeast Asia, especially during the 18th century. Softer instruments commonly heard in nontheatrical indoor settings, such as the saung gauk (harp) and pattala (bamboo xylophone), typically accompany singing from a compendium of Burmese songs called Mahagita (Great Music). Since colonial times, musicians of Myanmar also have incorporated various instruments of Western origin into their indigenous musical traditions, reworking the instruments sound, repertoire, and playing technique to reflect local aesthetics. For example, a significant repertoire of music has been developed for the piano, locally called sandaya, that is stylistically evocative of the circle of tuned drums, the harp, and the xylophone. Wood carving, lacquerwork, goldwork, silverwork, and the sculpting of Buddhist images and mythological figures also survived during colonial rule; there has been a revival of these and other indigenous art traditions under government patronage. Both the arts of bronze casting among the Burmans and of making bronze drums among the Karen and Shan, however, disappeared. The cinema and rock-based popular music are two international art forms that have been accepted into the cultural life of Myanmar. Burmese literature is an intimate blend of religious and secular genres. It remained alive throughout the colonial period and, in both verse and prose, has continued to thrive. A later (though not entirely new) development was biography, which has become more popular than fiction. Government-sponsored awards are given annually for the best translation, the best novel, and the best biography. Among Myanmars most prominent cultural institutions are the state schools of dance, music, drama, and fine arts at Yangon and Mandalay, as well as the National Museum of Art and Archaeology at Yangon. There also is an archaeological museum at Pagan. A number of other museums focus on state and regional history. Since 1962 the government has strictly controlled and censored all media. The New Light of Myanmar (published in English and Burmese), which is the most prominent of several daily newspapers, is the official voice of the government. Several underground print newspapers circulate irregularly, and the opposition newspaper BurmaNet News is available electronically, although it is difficult to obtain in Myanmar. The government-operated Myanma TV and Radio Department has television programming in Burmese and Arakanese and radio programming in Burmese, English, and a number of local languages. Some foreign radio servicesmost notably Radio Free Asia, Voice of America, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and the Democratic Voice of Burma (an opposition station operated out of Norway by Burmese expatriates)are an important source of international as well as domestic news. Internet use is highly restricted. Maung Htin Aung Michael Arthur Aung-Thwin David I. Steinberg "},{"CountryName":"Namibia","CulturalInfo":" Administration and social conditions  Government Namibia is a republic. The countrys constitution, which took effect at independence in 1990 and has since been amended, is highly rights-conscious and aimed at achieving a durable separation of powers. Executive power is vested in the president, who serves as head of state and government and is directly elected to a five-year term, the vice president, who is appointed by the president, and the cabinet, which consists of the prime minister and other ministers who are also appointed by the president. Legislative power is vested in the bicameral Parliament. The National Assembly is constituted to initiate and pass legislation. It consists of 96 members who are directly elected to five-year terms under universal adult suffrage and up to 8 members who are appointed by the president and do not have voting rights. The second house, the National Council, serves in an advisory capacity on legislative matters and comprises three representatives from each of Namibias 14 administrative regions. National Council members are elected by Regional Councils and serve six-year terms. The judicial system comprises the Supreme Court, the High Court, and lower courts. Internationally, Namibia hastened to join regional organizations (e.g., the Southern African Development Coordination Conference and the Organization of African Unity, now the African Union) as well as global bodies (the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the EC Lom Conventions, and the Commonwealth). Its relations with South Africa have been pragmatic and surprisingly noncontentious (on the South African side as well).   Education The government offers seven years of primary education and five years of secondary education. Primary education is compulsory and may be completed between the ages 6 and 16. More than 80 percent of all children of age for primary education are enrolled in schoola figure higher than that in many African countries. With more than 80 percent of its adult population literate, Namibia has one of the highest rates of literacy in sub-Saharan Africa. Various informal adult education programs have been implemented to combat the remaining illiteracy. Higher education is provided by the University of Namibia and the Polytechnic of Namibia, both located in Windhoek, and four teacher-training colleges.   Health and welfare Most Namibians are poorabout half of the population falls below the poverty lineand nutritional standards are low. Undernutrition and malnutrition are problematic, especially among children. Formal wage employment engages less than half of the workforce, and unemployment is high. An unfortunate legacy of Namibias colonial past is apparent in the income disparity between Blacks and whites, whose average incomes are several times higher than those of Black Namibians. Namibia has one of the best health care systems in Africa, as measured by both its population-to-doctor and its population-to-hospital-bed ratios. Emphasis is placed on primary and preventative health services, and the countrys system of regional hospitals and mobile clinics has attempted to raise the level of services available in rural locations. The AIDS epidemic is a serious problem in Namibia. The country has one of the highest infection rates in the world: by 2000 one in five adults was infected, and the number of HIV/AIDS cases overwhelmed the governments health care system. To curb the spread of the disease, the government developed prevention and treatment strategies and in 2003 began offering free antiretroviral treatment. Women and children, being the most disadvantaged groups, have received special attention in social policy. In the case of women, ending legal and social discrimination and improving access to education, land, and employment are stated goals toward which some action has begun. The government has also sought to meet the child health, education, nutrition, and other goals adopted by the 1990 World Summit on Children.   Cultural life Namibian cultures are diverse. Just as the culture of the Afrikaners differs significantly from that of the German-speaking community and as both of those cultures differ from that of the more varied technical-assistance community, so do African and Creole cultures differ. The Rehobothers closely resemble the rural Afrikaner culture of the mid-20th century, while the Nama have more in common with the other pastoral Black communities, and the Cape Coloured have a distinct urban culture with both Black and European elements. The northern Black cultureswhile distinctive as to language and forms of music and danceformed out of a mixed farming context unlike that of the Damara and Herero. The San are a tragic case. Their culture was ruined by ranch serfdom and wartime exploitation as trackers, and efforts to rebuild from the fragments have been limited by lack of knowledge, resources, and space as well as by the paternalism of many of their self-appointed guardians. With the exception of the San, Namibian cultures appear to be alive and evolving, not least in the urban areas. However, rising unemployment may lead to the breakdown of neighbourhood and other social groupings and to the anomie and lawlessness that characterize the townships of many southern African cities, notably in both Zambia and South Africa. The Black cultures are not well supported by formal institutions or the government, owing both to doubts as to what would enable rather than smother their development and to a lack of fiscal resources. A number of holidays and festivals are observed, most of which are religious or historic in significance, albeit not necessarily of specific current content. Sports are popular among both spectators and participants. A wide variety of sports are followed by the white communities, but the Black communities concentrate on football (soccer). Radio and television broadcasting services are government-owned, as is one daily newspaper. All appear to have substantial intellectual and programmatic freedom. A fluctuating band of party, semiparty, and (in one case) independent newspapers exist and are not subject to censorship, but the survival of most is in doubt for economic reasons. They are supplemented by an array of religious, trade union, and other specialized papers that also have complete freedom of expression. Reginald Herbold Green "},{"CountryName":"Nepal","CulturalInfo":" Government and society  Constitutional framework Although reforms in the 1950s began to move the kingdom toward a democratic political system, the crown dissolved parliament in 1960 and subsequently banned political parties. Thereafter, Nepal became only nominally a constitutional monarchy, and the constitution of 1962 (amended 1967, 1976, and 1980) effectively gave the king autocratic control over a multitiered system of panchayats (local bodies, or councils). In the 1980s, political restrictions were eased, and organizations such as the Nepali Congress Party, the Communist Party of Nepal, numerous small left-leaning student groups, and several radical Nepalese antimonarchist groups were allowed to operate more or less openly. Political parties, however, were not again legalized until 1990, when nationwide unrest forced King Birendra to accept the formation of a multiparty parliamentary system. A new constitution promulgated on November 9, 1990, greatly reduced the power of the monarchy. The king remained the head of state, but effective executive power was given to the Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister. Appointed by the king, the prime minister was required to be either the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives (the lower house of parliament) or, if there was no majority party, a representative who could form a coalition majority. The king was constitutionally also a part of parliament and was charged with giving assent to bills that had been passed by both legislative chambersthe House of Representatives and the National Council (the upper house). The House of Representatives consisted of 205 members popularly elected to five-year terms. The 60 members of the National Council held six-year terms; 10 were nominated by the king, 35 were elected by the House of Representatives (of which 3 had to be women), and 15 were selected by an electoral college. The constitution gave the House of Representatives considerably more power than the National Council. All Nepalese citizens age 18 and older are eligible to vote. Because most voters in Nepal are illiterate, candidates largely have been chosen by party symbol (e.g., a tree for the Nepali Congress Party and a sun for the United Marxist-Leninist Party of Nepal). Some voters, moreover, have had to travel long distances, in some cases for hours along mountain paths, in order to reach a polling station. Prior to 1990 the country was divided for administrative purposes into 5 development regions, 14 zones, and 75 districts; in addition there were corresponding regional, zonal, and district courts, as well as a Supreme Court. The 1990 constitution mandated the elimination of the regional and zonal courts, which were to be replaced by appellate courts. The administrative divisions themselves continued to exist as provisional units. The early 21st century was a tumultuous yet transformative period in Nepals governmental history. A Maoist insurgency that had been gaining strength since the late 1990s demanded not only the election of a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution but also the abolition of the monarchy. As the insurgents negotiated with the government, tensions escalated into violence. Following intermittent peace talks, abortive cease-fires, dissolution and reconstitution of the House of Representatives, and major abrogation of the kings authority, the Maoists and the government finally agreed to the drafting of an interim constitutionpromulgated in January 2007and the formation of an interim administration. Elections for a constituent assembly of some 600 members were held in April 2008, and the following month the monarchy was indeed dissolved and Nepal declared a republic. The country continued to operate for several more years under an interim constitution that provided for a unicameral legislature and a Council of Ministers, with most of the power vested in the prime minister. Protracted negotiations finally produced a new permanent constitution in 2015, which was approved by the legislature and promulgated on September 20. The document established a secular federal-style republic consisting of seven administrative regions and a bicameral legislature. A president would be head of state, and the Council of Ministers, led by the prime minister, would continue as head of government. The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica   Security Nepals armed forces consist of the Royal Nepalese Army, predominantly an infantry force. The Army Flight Department operates all aircraft. Except for a few simple weapons, all military supplies are imported. Nepal is famous for the fighting qualities of its Gurkha soldiers; nearly 5,000 of them serve in British Gurkha units and 50,000 in Indian Gurkha units. The British maintain a recruiting centre at Pokhar. Gurkha veterans are a valuable human resource of Nepal. For police purposes, the country is divided into three zones: eastern, central, and western, with headquarters at Birtnagar, Kathmandu, and Nepalganj, respectively. Each zonal headquarters, under a deputy inspector general of police, is responsible for several subsections composed of four to five police districts operating under a superintendent of police. A district superintendent is in charge of police stations in his area, and each station normally is supervised by a head constable.   Health and welfare The Ministry of Health is responsible for the support and administration of public health services, including hospitals and health clinics. Although the government has taken steps to improve existing health centres and to establish new ones, health care remains inadequate. Malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, and typhoid are prevalent in spite of government projects to control or eradicate them. Ayurvedic medicine, the traditional Hindu system of medicine, is popular in Nepal.   Education The Ministry of Education and Culture is responsible for administration and supervision of all elementary and secondary education. Higher education has developed relatively recently. The first college was established in 1918, and Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, with faculties of arts, sciences, commerce, and education, was chartered in 1959. The University Senate has sole legal responsibility for higher education and the authority to grant academic recognition to colleges but is largely dependent upon the Ministry of Education for funds.   Cultural life The relaxation of censorship that followed the overthrow of Rana rule in 1951 encouraged a revival of artistic and intellectual expression. In literature and poetry, Nepali works emphasize the cultural renaissance and national patriotism. King Mahendra, a poet whose Nepali lyrics have been published in English translation under the name of M.B.B. Shah (for Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah), did much to promote the revival of arts and literature. The cultural heritage of Nepal, particularly contributions made by the Newar of Kathmandu Valley to sculpture, painting, and architecture, is a source of great pride. Hindu and Buddhist religious values have provided the basic source of inspiration to Newar artisans. The themes of most artistic works have been primarily religious; the lives of the gods, saints, and heroes and the relationship of man to society and to the universe are expounded in sculpture, architecture, and drama. In Kathmandu Valley some 2,500 temples and shrines display the skill and highly developed aesthetic sense of Newar artisans. Music and dance are favourite pastimes among the Nepalese. Religious ceremonies require the use of drums and wind instruments preserved from ancient times. Important in most religious and family occasions are devotional songs that have elements of both classical and folk music and that have been used by some contemporary musical revivalists in their attempt to bridge the gap between the two. The government-owned Radio Nepal broadcasts programs in Nepali and English. The countrys first television station, at Kathmandu, began broadcasting in 1986. Newspapers and periodicals are published in Nepali and in English. Newspapers are frequently sensational in tone and are poorly staffed and financed. Gorkha Patra, published by the government, occupies a commanding position in the Nepalese press. Nepalese newspaper readers rely on the foreign press, particularly Indian newspapers, which are flown daily into Kathmandu, for more sophisticated coverage of world and national news. After 1960 King Mahendra required newspapers to obtain official clearance for all reports of political activity. Subsequently the government increased its censorship, and in 1985 the publication of many newspapers was suspended. In 1990, reflecting the change in the countrys political climate, freedom of the press was restored. Pradyumna P. Karan "},{"CountryName":"Netherlands","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life The cultural life of the Netherlands is varied and lively. Dutch painting and crafts are world renowned, and Dutch painters are among the greatest the world has ever known. The Dutch themselves take great pride in their cultural heritage, and the government is heavily involved in subsidizing the arts, while abjuring direct artistic control of cultural enterprises. Indeed, the long-enduring tradition of Dutch freedom of expression has undoubtedly played a significant role in the flowering of Dutch culture through the ages. Daily life and social customs The symbols of Dutchnesswooden shoes, lace caps, tulips, and windmillsare known throughout the world, but they tell only a small part of the story of contemporary life in the Netherlands. Except in places such as Vollendam and Marken and on occasions of national celebration, traditional dress long ago gave way to a style of dress in line with that of the rest of northern Europe. Flowering bulbs and tubers, including tulips, remain an important export commodity, and various festivals celebrate them. They are also displayed in the annual spring flower exhibition at Keukenhof Gardens and in venues such as the Aalsmeer flower market. Dutch cuisine is notable for many individual dishes, including filled pancakes (pannekoeken); pastries such as banket (an almond paste-filled treat), oliebollen (a deep-fried pastry dusted with powdered sugar), and speculaas (spice cookies); and a great variety of hard cheeses, including Edam and Gouda, the world-renowned varieties that originated in the towns for which they are named. Jenever, the Dutch ancestor of gin, is a malted barley-based spirit produced in two basic types, jonge (young) and oude (old, which contains a higher percentage of malt wine and thus is stronger and often yellowish as a result of the aging of the malt wine). Both types contain a variety of botanicals, notably juniper (genever), for flavouring. Dutch licorice, which is exceptionally salty, is a popular candy. Indonesian rijsttafel (rice table)which developed as a method by which Dutch plantation owners could sample many Indonesian foods in the colonieswas imported to the Netherlands and has become a staple cuisine in larger Dutch cities. In addition to the holidays of Christian tradition (Easter, Christmas, Pentecost, and Ascension), the Dutch celebrate Queens Day (April 30), Remembrance Day (May 4), and Liberation Day (May 5), though the last is commemorated only at five-year intervals. The arts Painting and sculpture Night WatchThe Company of Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburch, better known as the Night Watch, oil on canvas by Rembrandt van Rijn, 1642; in the collection of the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. 363  437 cm.(more)The history of Dutch painting offers such a deep, rich lode of names that only a few can be touched on here. Certainly among the most revered are those of Rembrandt van Rijn and Vincent van Gogh. Rembrandt, painting in the 17th century, became a master of light and shadow, a technique reflected in his landscapes as well as such portraits as his monumental group portrait now known as Night Watch. Van Gogh, born in the 19th century, was a powerful influence in the development of modern art. Among other great painters of the Low Countries are Jan van Eyck, the founder of the Flemish school; allegorist Hironymus Bosch; portraitist Frans Hals; landscapists Albert Cuyp and Jacob van Ruisdael; still-life artists such as Johannes Vermeer, Willem Heda, and Willem Kalf; and the geometrically inclined Piet Mondrian. (For a broader discussion of Dutch painting, see painting, Western.) Highlights of Dutch architecture range from the Dutch Baroque works of Pieter Post to 21st-century practitioners such as Rem Koolhaas. The Schroeder House (1924), in Utrecht, designed by De Stijl architect Gerrit Thomas Rietveld, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2000. Literature and the performing arts Dutch literature and theatre have always been handicapped by the smallness of the proportion of the human race that speaks Dutch. Perhaps the greatest name of Dutch letters was that of the Renaissance humanist Erasmus. Contemporary Dutch writers who are internationally known include Harry Mulisch and Cees Nooteboom. The countrys performing arts are widely encouraged and supported. The National Ballet at Amsterdam and the Netherlands Dance Theatre at The Hague are internationally renowned. Theatre companies are all private foundations, though the state and the municipalities provide financial assistance. The Dutch film industry is small. Among the most noteworthy recent directors are Johan van der Keuken, Marleen Gorris, and Paul Verhoeven. The International Film Festival Rotterdam is the countrys leading film festival, and the Nederlands Filmmuseum in Amsterdam is the national motion picture archive. Music The Netherlands has not produced composers of the stature of some of its neighbouring countries, although it has built a fine reputation for performance. The Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra is world famous, and the Residentie Orchestra at The Hague and the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra also have fine reputations. Various other towns have orchestras and choral groups, and there is a Dutch National Opera Company. Noted musical events include the World Music Festival at Kerkrade and the North Sea Jazz Festival at Rotterdam. Cultural institutions The Netherlands has a rich range of state-supported museums. The most famous is the Rijksmuseum at Amsterdam, noted for its collection of works by the great 17th-century Dutch masters (especially Rembrandt). Other major museums endowed by the state include the Mauritshuis in The Hague, Het Loo (the former royal palace) in Apeldoorn, and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, recognized for its collection of contemporary paintings. Two museums, the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh in Amsterdam and the Rijksmuseum Krller-Mller in Otterlo (Veluwe), are renowned for their collections of paintings by van Gogh. Often overlooked are a number of exceptional smaller museums such as the Huis Lambert van Meerten (Lambert van Meerten House) in Delft and the Nederlands Tegelmuseum (Netherlands Tile Museum) in Otterlo, both of which specialize in tiles. The most popular folk museums are the Openluchtmuseum (Open Air Museum) at Arnhem and the Zuiderzeemuseum at Enkhuizen. Sports and recreation Favourite regions for open-air recreation are the seacoasts with their wide sandy beaches and the many interior lakes in the western and northern parts of the country. They are frequented by both Dutch and foreign visitors. The Dutch also are attracted to hilly areas, such as the Veluwe, while foreign visitors go in droves to the old cities in the western part of the country, with Amsterdam ranking as the most popular destination. Favourite foreign vacation spots for the Dutch are the Mediterranean coasts during the summer holidays and the Alps during winter holidays. Cycling is a popular activityfor commuting, recreation, and sportinvolving at least half the population. Other favourite sports include tennis, field hockey, and ice skating. The Elfstedentocht is a popular ice-skating race that passes through 11 cities in the province of Friesland; it is held only during winters with heavy ice. The Dutch are also avid players and fans of football (soccer), and club teams such as the storied Ajax of Amsterdam and the Dutch national team have experienced much international success, not least in the 1970s, when the national team, led by Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens, pioneered the concept of total football, which calls for players with all-around skills to perform both defensive and attacking duties. The Netherlands made its Olympic debut in the 1900 Games in Paris, and the Summer Games were held in Amsterdam in 1928. Dutch Olympic athletes have won medals in cycling, speed skating, and swimming. Media and publishing The constitution guarantees freedom of the press but does not allow journalists to protect their sources. The Dutch press has a long-standing reputation for high-quality reporting, newspapers having been printed in Amsterdam as early as 1618. One of the oldest newspapers in Europe is the Oprechte Haerlemse Courant, now called the Haarlems Dagblad, which was founded in 1656. By far the greatest circulation is enjoyed by the right-of-centre De Telegraaf, from Amsterdam. The most widely read newspapers in political and intellectual circles are the liberal NRC Handelsblad in Rotterdam and the left-leaning De Volkskrant in Amsterdam. Several free tabloids and Internet-based dailies have taken over some market share. The majority of radio and broadcast television transmissions are produced by a small number of associations, all under private initiative. They were originally very much part of the pillarization system, and each represented a political or religious point of view, such as Roman Catholicism, various forms of Protestantism, Socialism, Humanism, and others. Most of these associations, however, have long since lost their ideological distinctiveness and illustrate how the shell of the pillarized system has remained in existence long after its contents have ebbed away. Nevertheless, religious organizations, political parties, and small factional groups are still guaranteed access to the airwaves by Netherlands Broadcasting Corporation, which is responsible for news and the programming of unreserved airtime. The government itself exerts no influence on the programming, and advertising is restricted and is controlled by a separate foundation. All public broadcasting is financed by a licensing fee and by the yield from television and radio advertising. Commercial broadcasting was introduced in the early 1990s, and there are now a host of terrestrial and satellite channels that can be received in most parts of the country, thanks to the extremely dense Dutch cable television network. Marcus Willem Heslinga Henk Meijer Michael J. Wintle"},{"CountryName":"New-Zealand","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life  Cultural milieu New Zealands cultural influences are predominantly European and Mori. Immigrant groups have generally tended to assimilate into the European lifestyle, although traditional customs are still followed by many Tongans, Samoans, and other Pacific peoples. Mori culture suffered greatly in the years of colonization and into the 20th century, and many Mori were torn between the pressure to assimilate and the desire to preserve their own culture. However, since the 1950s there has been a cultural renaissance, with a determined effort to preserve and revive artistic and social traditions. The culture of the Pkeh (the Mori term for those of European descent) has come to incorporate many aspects of Mori culture. The biennial Te Matatini festival, first held in 1972, celebrates Mori culture, especially the traditional dance and song performances known as kapa haka. The festival is held over several days, each time in a different region of New Zealand, and culminates in the national kapa haka championship. The state has moved progressively to assist and encourage the arts. Creative New Zealand, the national agency for arts funding, gives annual grants in support of theatre, music, modern dance and ballet, opera, and literature. In addition, New Zealand was one of the first countries to establish a fund to compensate writers for the loss of royalties on books borrowed from libraries rather than purchased. The national orchestra is supported by the government through the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. The government also provides taxation and other incentives for the motion-picture industry, and New Zealand-made films have received growing international recognition.   Daily life and social customs carvings; Mori meetinghouse, New ZealandCarvings in front of a Mori meetinghouse in New Zealand.(more)The Mori culture has seen a renaissance in wood carving and weaving and in the construction of carved and decorated meeting houses (whare whakairo). Mori waiata (songs) and dances have become increasingly popular, especially among the young. Mori meetingswhether hui (assemblies) or tangi (funeral gatherings)are conducted in traditional fashion, with ancient greeting ceremonies strictly observed. Waves of migrants have also brought different cultures that are celebrated in a variety of waysfor example, in annual festivals such as the Chinese Lantern Festival and Lunar New Year and the Indian festival Diwali. New Zealand cuisine has also been influenced by the foods of immigrants and the expectations of international tourists. It was originally a combination of traditional British dishes with local delicacies. Fresh seafood was popular along the coasts; mutton, venison, and meat pies were common. Pavlova, a sweet meringue dish, was and remains a popular dessert. Food, however, has become more imaginative and cosmopolitan, and there are many restaurants, bistros, and cafs in the major cities and towns that present a range of classic and ethnic menus. A traditional Mori feast of meat, seafood, and vegetables is steamed for hours in an earthen oven (hng). Mori womens choirA Mori womens choir performing on Waitangi Day.(more)New Zealand celebrates a number of national public holidays. Waitangi DayFebruary 6, the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi (1840)is considered the countrys national day. Commemorations are centred on Waitangi but are held throughout the country. Public celebrations include Mori ceremonies as well as sporting events, music, and parades. With the increasing attention paid to Mori history and culture, Waitangi Day has also become an occasion for reflection on the historical effects of European settlement on the indigenous people. Another, more sombre, public holiday is ANZAC DayApril 25, the day in 1915 when amphibious New Zealand and Australian (ANZAC) forces landed at the Gallipoli Peninsula (Turkey) and began one of the iconic battles of World War I. The holiday honours those who have served in New Zealands military forces, especially those killed in war.   The arts Katherine MansfieldThe arts in New Zealand have been strongly influenced by the desire to establish a national identity distinct from that of other cultures. Numerous writers were active in the late 19th century, the most successful of whom were historians, such as William Pember Reeves, and ethnologists, including S. Percy Smith and Elsdon Best. The work of the first genuinely original New Zealand writers, the short-story author Katherine Mansfield and the poet R.A.K. Mason, did not appear until the 1920s. In the 1930s, during the harsh years of the Great Depression, a group of poets appeared and established a national tradition of writing. Although influenced by contemporary English literatureT.S. Eliot and W.H. Auden were greatly respectedthey wrote about their New Zealand experience. The most-notable member of this group was Allen Curnow. A.R.D. Fairburn, Denis Glover, and Charles Brasch were other major poets. At the same time, Frank Sargeson began writing the superb stories in the New Zealand vernacular for which he became well known. The work of those pioneering writers was followed by that of such widely published and acclaimed poets as James K. Baxter, Kendrick Smithyman, Ian Wedde, and Elizabeth Smither. A number of novelists have also earned international reputations, notably Janet Frame, Keri Hulme, Sylvia Ashton-Warner, Lloyd Jones, and mystery writer Ngaio Marsh. Authors Witi Ihimaera and Patricia Grace explored the intersection of Mori and Pkeh culture. Poet Hone Tuwhare has achieved an international reputation. Those and other New Zealand writers were greatly aided by the growth of the publishing industry in New Zealand.

In the 1960s, however, an unprecedented art scene began to emerge, created initially by a group of artists, including Colin McCahon and Don Binney, who were helped by the rise of commercial galleries in most large towns and cities. Although New Zealand is often the subject of those paintings, they clearly reflect international influences. That group paved the way for what has become a small legion of artists. Since the late 20th century, Mori arts have experienced growing popularity, and works of visual art are prominently displayed in numerous galleries and museums.

New Zealand singers who garnered an international following include Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Inia Te Wiata, and Donald McIntyre.

The films of New Zealand directors Jane Campion and Peter Jackson had notable success around the world; Campions The Piano (1993) and Jacksons The Lord of the Rings trilogy (200103) in particular received much acclaim. The work of actors Sam Neill, Anna Paquin, Lucy Lawless, and New Zealand-born Australian Russell Crowe has been recognized internationally.  "},{"CountryName":"Nicaragua","CulturalInfo":" Education of NicaraguaOne of the first acts by the Sandinistas following the revolution of 1979 was to declare a year of literacy, whereby the government sent out cadres of former guerrilla fighters to teach reading to the largely illiterate rural populace. This literacy crusade reduced adult illiteracy from more than 50 percent to less than 15 percent. Standard education at all levels was also greatly expanded. At the start of the 21st century, about four-fifths of the population was literate, one-fifth of Nicaraguans had no formal schooling, and only a small percentage of the population had a university degree. Nicaraguas oldest universities are the National Autonomous University (1812) and the Central American University (1961). Several other universities were founded in the 1980s and 90s.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Nicaragua has rich cultural traditions that reflect long-standing ethnic cleavages. The western part of the country is culturally similar to other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. Its folk traditions are expressed in beautiful arts and crafts (ceramics, textiles, and wood and leather handicrafts), religious ceremonies, and country music (corridos). The eastern part of Nicaragua has a more Afro-Caribbean flavour, similar to other former British colonies in the region.   Daily life and social customs As is the case in much of Central America, Nicaraguan social life is centred on family and fictional kinship. Most children are given godparents, who help organize the childs baptism and serve as mentors throughout their childhood. Many social events are tied to the Roman Catholic Church, and each Nicaraguan town or city holds an annual celebration to honour its patron saint. The celebration of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary (referred to locally as La Pursima) is the countrys most important holiday, and the nine-day festival includes the building of altars to be placed at the doorways of private homes and the creation of floats to be paraded through town. Another tradition in Nicaragua is the annual performance of El Gegense, a satirical drama that depicts resistance to colonial rule. The spectacular is performed in January during the feast of San Sebastin, patron saint of the city of Diriamba, and combines folk music, dance, and theatre. El Gegense, whose name derives from the Nahuatl term gege (old one), was a powerful elder in pre-Columbian Nicaragua who was compliant when in the presence of the colonists but ridiculed them behind their backs. The drama was recognized by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2005. Nicaraguan cuisine is a mixture of indigenous and Creole traditions. The countrys national dish is gallo pinto (fried rice mixed with black beans and other spices). Corn (maize) is the staple of Nicaraguan gastronomy and is used in many foods, such as nacatamal (cornmeal dough stuffed with meat and cooked in plantain leaves), indio viejo (corn tortilla with meat, onions, garlic, sweet pepper, and tomato and cooked in orange juice and broth), and sopa de albndiga (meatball soup). The traditional drink known as chicha is made with corn, water, and sugar. Appetizers called rosquillas are made with baked corn dough, cheese, and butter. The Caribbean region has its own traditional dishes, such as rondn (turtle meat, fish, or pork combined with various condiments). A drink found only in this region of the country is gaubal (cooked green banana, milk, coconut water, and sugar).   The arts The drama and emotions of the insurrectionary and revolutionary periods from the late 1970s through 1990 produced a flourishing of artistic expression. Masterly work was exemplified in the paintings of Alejandro Canales, Armando Morales, and Leoncio Senz and the theatre of Alan Bolt. Nicaraguan folk music is popular both locally and throughout Central America and Mexico. Much of this music was made popular by ethnomusicologist and composer Salvador Cardenal Argello, who traveled throughout the country in the 1930s. Many contemporary Nicaraguan folk artists work from Cardenals songbook, remaking songs that were popular in the first half of the 20th century. In the 1970s the New Song movement, a form of traditional Latin American folk music mixed with political and social commentary, was led by Nicaraguan brothers Luis Enrque Meja Godoy and Carlos Meja Godoy, who continued to perform into the 1990s, often with other artists, including Katia Cardenal and guitarist Eduardo Araica. The English-speaking town of Bluefields, on the Caribbean coast, has emerged as a centre of reggae music. Nicaraguan palo de mayo (maypole dance) music is also popular in the region and is easily recognized by its incessant rhythm. Inspired by the British, the annual monthlong Maypole festival in Bluefields is an amalgam of European and Afro-Caribbean traditions centred on a decorated maypole; festivities include parades, costumes, music, and dancing. Nicaragua prides itself on a long and distinguished literary tradition, which until the late 20th century was familiar within the country only to the educated elite. Among the countrys best-known writers are Rubn Daro, known as the prince of Spanish-American poetry, Ernesto Cardenal, who established a literary and visual arts centre that has attracted international writers and artists, the novelist Sergio Ramrez, the essayist Omar Cabezas, and the poet Gioconda Belli.  "},{"CountryName":"Nigeria","CulturalInfo":"Security of NigeriaThe Nigeria Police Force, established by the federal constitution, is headed by the inspector general of police, who is appointed by the president. The general inefficiency of the force is attributable in part to the low level of education and the low morale of police recruits, who are poorly housed and very poorly paid, and to the lack of modern equipment. Corruption is widespread. The federal military includes army, navy, and air force contingents. Nigerian troops have participated in missions sponsored by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and by the United Nations (UN). Health and welfare The concentration of people in the cities has created enormous sanitary problems, particularly improper sewage disposal, water shortages, and poor drainage. Large heaps of domestic refuse spill across narrow streets, causing traffic delays, while the dumping of garbage along streambeds constitutes a major health hazard and has contributed to the floods that have often plagued Ibadan, Lagos, and other cities during the rainy season. Lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, malaria, and HIV/AIDS are among the leading causes of death. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control was established in 2011 to support public health. Health conditions are particularly poor in the shantytown suburbs of Greater Lagos and other large cities, where domestic water supplies are obtained from wells that are often polluted by seepage from pit latrines. Rural communities also suffer from inadequate or impure water supplies. Some villagers have to walk as far as 6 miles (10 km) to the nearest water pointusually a stream. Because people wash clothes, bathe, and fish (sometimes using fish poison) in the same streams, the water drawn by people in villages farther downstream is often polluted. During the rainy season, wayside pits containing rainwater, often dug close to residential areas, are the main source of domestic water supplies. Cattle are often watered in the shallower pools, and this contributes to the high incidence of intestinal diseases and guinea worm in many rural areas. Medical and health services are the responsibility of all levels of government. There are hospitals in the large cities and towns. Most of the state capitals have specialized hospitals, and many are home to a university teaching hospital. There are numerous private hospitals, clinics, and maternity centres. Medical services are inadequate in many parts of the country, however, because of shortages of medical personnel, modern equipment, and supplies. Housing Overcrowding in the cities has caused slums to spread and shantytown suburbs to emerge in most of the larger urban centres. Most houses are built by individuals, and, because banks do not normally lend money for home construction, most of these individuals must rely on their savings. A federal housing program provides funds for the construction of low-cost housing for low- and middle-income workers in the state capitals, local government headquarters, and other large towns.

(more)House types vary by geographic location. In the coastal areas the walls and roofs are made from the raffia palm, which abounds in the region. Rectangular mud houses with mat roofs are found in the forest belt, although the houses of the more prosperous have corrugated iron roofs. In the savanna areas of the central region and in parts of the north, houses are round mud buildings roofed with sloping grass thatch, but flat mud roofs appear in the drier areas of the extreme north. Some mud houses are also covered with a layer of cement. Larger houses are designed around an open courtyard and traditionally contained barrels or cisterns in which rainwater could be collected. During the colonial period, British officials lived in segregated housing known as Government Reserve Areas (GRA). After independence GRA housing became very desirable among the African population. Education Great Britain did little to promote education during the colonial period. Until 1950 most schools were operated by Christian missionary bodies, which introduced Western-style education into Nigeria beginning in the mid-19th century. The British colonial government funded a few schools, although its policy was to give grants to mission schools rather than to expand its own system. In the northern, predominantly Muslim area, Western-style education was prohibited because the religious leaders did not want Christian missionaries interfering with Islam, and Islamic education was provided in traditional Islamic schools. Today primary education, free and compulsory, begins at age six and lasts for six years. Secondary education consists of two three-year cycles, the first cycle of which is free and compulsory. Although federal and state governments have the major responsibility for education, other organizations, such as local governments and religious groups, may establish and administer primary and secondary schools. Most secondary schools, trade centres, technical institutes, teacher-training colleges, and colleges of education and of technology are controlled by the state governments. Zaria, Nigeria: Ahmadu Bello UniversitySenate Building, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.(more)Nigeria has more than 400 universities and colleges widely dispersed throughout the country in an attempt to make higher education easily accessible. Many of the universities are federally controlled, and the language of instruction is English at all the universities and colleges. At the time of Nigerias independence in 1960, there were only two established postsecondary institutions, both of which were located in the southwestern part of the country: University College at Ibadan (founded in 1948, now the University of Ibadan) and Yaba Higher College (founded in 1934, now Yaba College of Technology). Four more government-operated universities were established in the 1960s: University of Nigeria, Nsukka (1960), in the east; University of Ife (founded in 1961, now Obafemi Awolowo University) in the west; University of Northern Nigeria (founded in 1962, now Ahmadu Bello University) in the north; and University of Lagos (1962) in the south. In the 1970s and 80s the government attempted to found a university in every state, but, with the ever-increasing number of states, this practice was abandoned. Numerous federal and state universities have since been established, especially during the 21st century. Attempts by individuals and private organizations, including various Christian churches, to establish universities did not receive the approval of the federal Ministry of Education until the 1990s. Since then, dozens of private postsecondary institutions have been established.Cultural life Cultural milieu Nigerias rich and varied cultural heritage derives from the mixture of its ethnic groups with Arabic and western European influences. The country combines traditional culture with international urban sophistication. Secret societies, such as Ekpo and Ekpe among the Igbo, were formerly used as instruments of government, while other institutions were associated with matrimony. According to the Fulani custom of sharo (test of young manhood), rival suitors underwent the ordeal of caning as a means of eliminating those who were less persistent. In Ibibio territory, girls approaching marriageable age were confined for several years in bride-fattening rooms before they were given to their husbands. A girl was well-fed during this confinement, with the intent of making her plump and therefore more attractive to her future husband; she would also receive instruction from older women on how to be a good wife. These and other customs were discouraged by colonial administrators and missionaries. Some of the more adaptable cultural institutions have been revived since independence; these include Ekpo and Ekong societies for young boys in parts of the southeast and the Ogboni society found in the Yoruba and Edo areas of southern Nigeria.

"},{"CountryName":"Niger","CulturalInfo":" Government and society  Constitutional framework Niger National Assembly buildingThe National Assembly building in Niamey, Niger(more)Under the constitution of 2010, Niger is a republic. The president, who serves as head of state, is elected to a five-year term by popular vote, with a limit of two terms. The president appoints the prime minister, who serves as the head of government. Legislative power is vested in the unicameral National Assembly; members are popularly elected and serve five-year terms. Nigers judicial system comprises the High Court of Justice, the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, and the Courts of First Instance. The constitution was suspended after a military coup in July 2023.   Local government For administrative purposes, Niger is divided into one capital districtNiameyand seven rgions (regions)Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Tahoua, Tillaberi, and Zindereach of which is administered by a prefect. Each region is further divided into several districts, with each district led by a subprefect.   Education NigerSchoolgirls waiting for lunch in a school in Maradi, Niger.(more)Education in Niger is free, but only a small proportion of children attend school. Primary and secondary schools and teacher-training colleges are the responsibility of the Ministry of National Education. Other ministries are responsible for technical education. Niger has one of the lowest adult literacy rates in western Africa, and literacy programs are conducted in the five principal African languages. Niamey has a university, and the Islamic University of Niger opened at Say in 1987.   Health and welfare The general state of health in the country is poor, and health care facilities are inadequate, especially in rural areas. The infant mortality rate, about 125 per 1,000 live births, is one of the highest in western Africa. Health services concentrate on the eradication of certain diseases in rural areas, as well as on health education. Campaigns have been successfully waged against sleeping sickness and meningitis, and vaccinations against smallpox and measles are administered. Other diseases, however, such as tuberculosis, malaria, and leprosy, remain endemic. Antituberculosis centres are located at Niamey, Zinder, and Tahoua. The lack of finances and shortage of trained personnel remain the principal obstacles to the improvement of health conditions.   Cultural life petroglyphThe Dabous giraffes, a Neolithic petroglyph in north-central Niger.(more)Niger forms part of the vast Sahelian cultural region of western Africa. Although the influence of Islam is predominant, pre-Islamic cultural traditions are also strong and omnipresent. Since independence, greater interest has been shown in the countrys cultural heritage, particularly with respect to traditional architecture, handicrafts, dances, and music. With the assistance of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, a regional centre for the collection of oral traditions has been established at Niamey. An institution prominent in cultural life is the National Museum at Niamey. Diould Laya The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica  History  This discussion focuses on Niger from the 14th century. For a treatment of earlier periods and of the country in its regional context, see western Africa, history of.   Early cultures One of the central themes of the history of Niger is the interaction between the Tuareg (and also Tubu) nomads of the vast Saharan north and the sedentary agriculturalists of the souththat is, the interaction between opposed yet complementary ways of life and civilizations. Among the agriculturalists the main ethnic groups are the Songhai-Zarma in the west, the Hausa in the centre, and the Kanuri in the east. The Hausa have always been the most numerous. They constitute nearly half of the total population of Niger. In the 14th century (possibly also earlier and later) the Tuareg-controlled kingdom of Takedda, west of the Ar Massif, played a prominent role in long-distance trade, notably owing to the importance of its copper mines. Copper was then used as a currency throughout western Africa. Archaeological evidence attests to the existence of communities of agriculturalists, probably Songhai-speaking, in this region, which is now desert, at the time of the kingdom of Takedda. Takedda was succeeded at an unknown date by the sultanate of Agadez. For many centuries the southeastern third of present-day Niger constituted one of the most important provinces of the Kanuri empire of Bornu. The might of Bornu was based on the control of a number of salt-producing sites and of long-distance trade, notably along the string of oases between Lake Chad and the Fezzan via Kawar. The great drought of about 173556the prelude to the present dry cycle, which set in about 1880had an adverse effect upon the natural environment. This may explain why both the communities of agriculturalists west of Ar and the oases between Lake Chad and Kawar disappeared. It may perhaps also explain in part why the Tuareg were able to extend their control over a fair portion of the sedentary south. At the time of the colonial conquest, the disparate regions the French molded into an entity known as Niger may be best described as an assemblage of peripheral borderlands. As borderlands, however, these regions had played a significant role as zones of refugethe west after 1591 and the Moroccan conquest of the Songhai empire and the Hausa region much later, after the 1804 Fulani jihad in central Hausaland (i.e., present-day northern Nigeria). In both cases the refugees were people who had lost in the military conflicts, as well as the religious struggles, of their respective homelands. Thus both regions became bastions of traditionalism in the face of partly alien conquerors attempting to impose Islam.   Colonial administration The French conquest began in earnest only in 1899. It nearly met with disaster owing to the local populations determined resistance against the notorious expedition in 1899 led by French Captains Paul Voulet and Charles-Paul-Louis Chanoine (also known as Julien Chanoine). It was only in 1922, after the severe drought and famine of 191315 and the Tuareg uprising of 191617, that the French felt safe enough to establish a regular administration under civilian control. By then the power of the Tuareg had been broken. As elsewhere, the peace in French West Africa (pax gallica) meant, among other things, the rapid spread of Islam, a steep demographic increase, and, although exclusively among the Hausa, the extension of cash crop cultivation. The Songhai-Zarma, on the other hand, responded to the French tax demands by engaging themselves as seasonal labourers in the coastal regions. Through the reforms of 1946, Frances African subjects were in theory granted full citizenship. Thus Niger, along with the other colonies (renamed overseas territories) in Black Africa, was represented in the French parliament. Consultative-legislative assemblies were also set up locally. These reforms secured the ascent of a tiny new elite, the so-called volusi.e., those who had been trained in French schools. Many were descendants of former slaves, and most were Songhai-Zarma. Indeed, the people of the west had proved to be far more open to European influence than, for instance, the Hausa. At least until 195455 the French administration (headed for 12 years by Governor Jean Toby) remained firmly in control of the political situation. The first local executive was established in 1957. Its head, the left-wing trade unionist Djibo Bakary, advocated a no vote in the referendum of 1958, but 72 percent of the votes cast were in favour of a continued link with France. Nevertheless, under Bakarys successor, his cousin and fellow Songhai-Zarma Hamani Diori, independence was proclaimed on August 3, 1960.

Although the country has received continuous streams of foreign cultural influence mainly from China, Koreans have kept their identity and maintained and developed their unique language and customs. Westernization, begun in the late 19th century, was accomplished in harmony with Korean tradition and slowly transformed the culture without much conflict until the 1940snotwithstanding Japanese attempts to obliterate Korean culture during its occupation of the peninsula. After World War II the occupying Soviets did not recognize the Korean traditional family system or Confucian philosophy; age-old lineage records were burned, and the kinship system was broken. Through education, people were molded to fit the pattern of party idealism, and private life and individual freedom became extremely limited. Development plans since the Korean War have demanded much from the North Koreans in terms of patience and labour. As a result, the people have had to lead an austere existence. The standard of living improved over time, but leisure and cultural activities have continued to be regimented and geared toward organized group activities, such as rallies and museum tours. The arts statue of Kim Il-SungStatue of Kim Il-Sung at the Korean Revolution Museum, Pyngyang, North Korea.(more)The government is heavily involved with maintaining and advancing the traditional fine arts and other cultural features as an expression of nationalism. Statues of Kim Il-sung and public art commemorating the revolution are ubiquitous. The selection of cultural items is based on communist ideology, and writers and artists attempt to enhance class consciousness and propagate the superiority and independence of Korean culture. All North Korean writers, artists, dancers, and musicians are assigned to government institutions such as the National Theatre for the Arts and the State Symphony Orchestra in Pyngyang and provincial organizations of music, ballet, and drama. The Pyngyang University of Music and Dance provides arts education. Museums have been well supported by the government, and many archaeological sites have been excavated to promote the growth of a strong nationalistic feeling. Among the countrys most notable museums are the Korean Revolution Museum and the Korean Fine Arts Museum in the capital. Archaeological sites include those located in the Nangnang district of Pyngyang and at Kungsan, near Yonggang. Press and broadcasting Of the daily newspapers, the Rodong (or Nodong) sinmun (Labour News), published by the KWP Central Committee, and the governments Minju Chosn (Democratic Korea) have the largest circulations. The monthly Klloja (Workers) of the KWP Central Committee is one of the most influential periodicals. The Korean Central News Agency controls the dissemination of information, and all papers are strictly censored. The government long has recognized the importance of radio and television as mass media, and they have played a great role in ideological education. Radio broadcasts reach all parts of the country. Almost all North Korean households have access to radio broadcasts as a result of a government project to link household loudspeakers to village receivers. Television broadcasting in North Korea also has been made available to all parts of the country, and the number of television sets, both imported and domestically produced, has increased. Chan Lee Woo-ik Yu History demilitarized zoneBridge crossing the military demarcation line between North and South Korea, Panmunjm, central Korea.(more)The following is a treatment of North Korea since the Korean War. For a discussion of the earlier history of the peninsula, see Korea. The Kim Il-Sung era In 1948, when the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea was established, Kim Il-Sung became the first premier of the North Korean communist regime. In 1949 he became chairman of the Korean Workers Party (KWP), created from communist parties founded earlier. Until his death in 1994, Kim ruled the country with an iron hand by promoting a personality cult centred on himself as the Great Leader of the Korean people. The 1950s and 60s In the aftermath of the Korean War, Kim purged the so-called domestic factionan indigenous communist group that had remained in Korea during the colonial periodamid much scapegoating for the disastrous war. After 1956, as the Sino-Soviet conflict intensified, Kim shifted his positions vis--vis Moscow and Beijing no fewer than three times: from pro-Soviet to neutral, to pro-Chinese, and finally to independent. During 195658, he carried out a purge against the pro-Chinese group known as the Yenan faction and eliminated a pro-Soviet faction from the KWP Central Committee. In 1966, after a visit to Pyngyang by Soviet Premier Aleksey N. Kosygin, Kim announced what became known as the independent party line in North Korea, which stressed the principles of complete equality, sovereignty, mutual respect, and noninterference among the communist and workers parties. From this party line, KWP theoreticians developed four self-reliance (juche) principles: autonomy in ideology, independence in politics, self-sufficiency in economy, and self-reliance in defense. In the late 1960s the regime implemented a program for strengthening the armed forces. As part of the effort to fortify the entire country, more military airfields were constructed and large underground aircraft hangars were built. In addition, a large standing army and a strong militia were maintained. North Koreas emphasis on strengthening its military forces proceeded hand in hand with its continued focus on the development of a self-reliant economy. With aid from the Soviet Union, China, and the countries of eastern Europe, North Korea implemented a series of economic development plans and made significant gains. But as external aid declined sharplyfirst from the Soviet Union beginning in the late 1950s and then from China at the start of the Cultural Revolution in the mid-1960sthe seven-year plan of 196167 was seriously affected, as indicated by the extension of the plan for another three years. Bae-ho Hahn Young Ick Lew "},{"CountryName":"North-Macedonia","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life Great effort has been invested in the support of Macedonian language and culture, not only through education but also through theatre and other arts as well as the media of mass communication.  Daily life and social customs As a result of the long presence of the Ottoman Turks in the region, the traditional cuisine of North Macedonia is not only based on Balkan and Mediterranean fare but also flavoured by Turkish influences. Among the countrys dishes of Turkish origin are kebapcinja (grilled beef kebabs) and the burek, a flaky pastry often stuffed with cheese, meat, or spinach. Macedonians also enjoy other foods that are common throughout the Balkans, including taratur (yogurt with shredded cucumber) and baklava. Macedonian specialties include ajvar (a sauce made from sweet red peppers), tavce gravce (baked beans), shopska salata (a salad combining sliced cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes with soft white cheese), and selsko meso (pork chops and mushrooms in brown gravy). In addition to Orthodox Christian and Islamic religious holidays, a number of holidays tied to the countrys history are celebrated in North Macedonia, including Independence Day (September 8), marking the day in 1991 when Macedonians voted for independence from federated Yugoslavia.   The arts Despite the refusal of Macedonias Serbian rulers to recognize Macedonian as a language, progress was made toward the foundation of a national language and literature in the early 20th century, especially by Krste P. Misirkov in his Za Makedonskite raboti (1903; In Favour of Macedonian Literary Works) and in the literary periodical Vardar (established 1905). These efforts were continued during the interval between World War I and World War II, most notably by the poet Kosta Racin. After World War II, Macedoniafreed to write and publish in its own languageproduced such literary figures as poets Aco opov, Slavko Janevski, Blae Koneski, and Gane Todorovski. Janevski also authored the first Macedonian novel, Selo zad sedumte jaseni (1952; The Village Beyond the Seven Ash Trees), and a cycle of six novels dealing with Macedonian history. After World War II, Macedonian theatre was invigorated by a wave of new dramatists that included Kole aule, Tome Arsovski, and Goran Stefanovski. Among the best-known fiction writers of prose are ivko ingo, Vlada Uroevi, and Jovan Pavlovski. (See Macedonian literature). The popular culture of North Macedonia is a fascinating blend of local tradition and imported influence. Folk music and folk dancing are still popular, and rock and pop music are ubiquitous. Icon painting and wood carving both have long histories in North Macedonia. Motion picture making in North Macedonia dates to the early 20th-century efforts of brothers Milton and Janaki Manaki and includes Before the Rain (1994), which was directed by Milcho Manchevski and was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language film.   Cultural institutions Located in Ohrid, the National Museum features an archaeological collection dating from prehistoric times. Ohrid itself is one of the oldest human settlements in Europe, and the natural and cultural heritage of the Ohrid region was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1980. Also of note are the Museum of Contemporary Art in Skopje and the Museum of the City of Skopje. Throughout the country, annual festivals are held, including the Skopje Jazz Festival, the Balkan Festival of Folk Songs and Dances in Ohrid, the Ohrid Summer Festival, and the pre-Lenten Carnival in Strumica. An international poetry festival is held annually in the lakeside resort of Struga.   Sports and recreation A modern sports culture was slow to develop in North Macedonia. In the post-World War II era, football (soccer) emerged as a popular sport, encouraged, along with basketball and volleyball, by the larger industrial firms, which often fielded their own teams. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, tennis began to grow in popularity in the larger urban centres. The 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., marked the first Games at which Macedonia was represented as an independent state. During the 1970s, winter sports gained considerably in popularity in North Macedonia, as the countrys mountainous terrain facilitated the creation of several ski resorts, especially in the ar Mountains, and near Mavrovo and Krushevo. There are also active mountaineering societies, maintaining huts in the Babuna massif south of Skopje, in the ar Mountains, and on Baba Mountain. Macedonians generally seem to prefer to take their fresh air and exercise in the form of mountaineering and hunting. On the other hand, chess has a wide and enthusiastic following in the country.   Media and publishing The Macedonian Information Agency (MIA), which provides news and public information, was originally chartered by the parliament in 1992 but did not begin operation until 1998. In 2006 the government transformed the MIA from public enterprise to joint-stock company. Founded in 1992, Makfax was the regions first private news agency. Although private competitors exist, the major provider of radio and television service is the government-operated Macedonia Radio Television, which began life as Radio Skopje in 1944.  "},{"CountryName":"Norway","CulturalInfo":" Health and welfare Compulsory membership in a national health-insurance system guarantees all Norwegians free medical care in hospitals, compensation for doctors fees, and free medicine, as well as an allowance to compensate for lost wages. Membership fees securing cash benefits during illness or pregnancy, covered by another insurance fund, are compulsory for salaried employees and optional for the self-employed. Most Norwegian doctors work in hospitals, the majority of which are owned by the state, counties, and municipalities. Extensive programs of preventive medicine have conquered Norways ancient nemesis, tuberculosis. There is also a well-developed system of maternal and child health care, as well as compulsory school health services and free family counseling by professionals. A public dental service provides care for children under age 18. A peoples pension was established in Norway in 1967 to ensure each citizen upon retirement a standard of living reasonably close to the level that the individual had achieved during his or her working life. The pension covers old age and cases of disability or loss of support. The premiums are paid by the individual members, employers, municipalities, and the state. The basic pension is adjusted every year, regardless of the plans income. Supplementary pensions vary according to income and pension-earning time. The state pays a family allowance for all children up to 18 years of age. Norway ranks among the top 10 countries of the world in GNP per capita and has one of the worlds highest standards of living. Since the 1950s Norwegians have spent a smaller share of their income than formerly on food, beverages, and tobacco. Travel and leisure activities have increased their share rapidly, however, as have such household goods as electrical appliances. During the 1960s the number of automobiles per inhabitant increased dramatically, from 1 in 21 persons having a automobile to 1 in 3; it now is about 1 in 2. By law, Norwegians are guaranteed 25 vacation days every year. Working hours may not exceed 9 hours a day or 40 hours per week. A five-day workweek had become the rule by the late 1960s. Norway has pursued progressive social policies. In 1993 it became the second country to legally recognize unions between homosexual partners. Indeed, in 2002 the conservative finance minister officially registered his partnership and met little public opposition. In 2009 same-sex marriage was legalized.   Housing Until the 1970s Norway felt the housing shortage created by World War II. The shortage was aggravated further by high costs in the densely populated urban areas. But housing standards have improved tremendously, and most families live in houses built since the wara majority of them financed by state loans on favourable terms. In densely populated areas, particularly in and around Oslo, housing prices soared beginning in the early 1990s but then fell precipitously in 200708 as a result of the global economic downturn, only to recover later in the decade.   Education School attendance is mandatory for 10 years, from age 6 to 16, with an optional 11th year. Mandatory subjects include Norwegian, religion, mathematics, music, physical education, science, and English. Optional courses in the arts and in other foreign languages, as well as vocational training in such areas as office skills, agriculture, and seamanship, are available in the upper grades. With three years of additional high school, students may take the examinations leading to university study. A small percentage of college and university students study abroad. Institutions of higher education in Norway have been expanded to accommodate the doubling of the student population that occurred between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s. Norways seven universities include four traditional universitiesthe University of Oslo (established 1811), the University of Bergen (1946), the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim (with roots in the Norwegian Institute of Technology, founded 1910), and the University of Troms (1968)along with the University of Stavanger, the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in s, and the University of Agder. There are also six university-level specialized institutions (including the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration in Bergen and the Norwegian Academy of Music) as well as about two dozen university colleges that predominantly offer three-year programs of study. Many students attend vocational schools, and a few thousand students attend folk high schools (generally boarding schools offering a one-year course designed for 17-year-old students from rural areas). The great majority of Norways schools are state-run and free; however, there are also private, fee-charging schools at every level. All students are eligible for government loans. Lifelong learning and continuing education programs for adults are also important components of the Norwegian education system. Science and research have limited means in a small country. Nevertheless, the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research at the Norwegian Institute of Technology (SINTEF) was created in 1950 as an independent organization at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology to stimulate research and develop cooperation with other public and private research institutions and with private industry. SINTEF is financed by the state and by payments for its services. In the natural sciences, reflecting the countrys intimacy with an overpowering physical environment, the individual efforts of Norwegians have won particular acclaim. Jan Christensen The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica   Cultural life Edvard GriegNorwegian composer Edvard Grieg.(more)Located on the outskirts of Europe and with much of its inland population almost completely isolated until the 20th century, Norway has been able to preserve much of its old folk culture, including a large body of legends concerning haugfolket (pixies), underjordiske (subterraneans), and vetter (supernatural beings). On the other hand, as seafarers and traders, the Norwegians have always received fresh cultural stimuli from abroad. A number of Norwegians have made important contributions in return, notably the playwright Henrik Ibsen (18281906) and the composer Edvard Grieg (18431907). The Norwegian recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature are Bjrnstjerne Bjrnson (1903), Knut Hamsun (1920), and Sigrid Undset (1928). "},{"CountryName":"Oman","CulturalInfo":"Cultural lifeDaily life and social customsOman is a tribal society, although tribal influence is gradually declining. Its predominantly Ib Muslim population observes social customs thatthough still conservative by Western standardsare markedly less strict than those of neighbouring Saudi Arabia. (The consumption of alcoholic beverages, for instance, is illegal for Omani citizens but is permissible for visitors in licensed dining establishments.) Women in particular have enjoyed relatively more freedom in Oman than elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula. Social interaction remains largely segregated by gender, however, and most Omani womenparticularly those in rural areasdress in a conservative, time-honoured fashion. Traditional attire for women, although varying slightly from region to region, is characterized by brightly coloured fabrics and jeweled adornments and consists of a dress (thawb) over loose-fitting slacks (sirwl). A long, flowing scarf known as a lif (or generically as ijab) covers the head. Similarly, most Omani men wear the dishdashah, or thawb, a traditional woven cotton robe, and male headgear consists of a light turban of cotton or wool, known as a muzzar. Many men continue to carry a short, broad, curved, and often highly ornate dagger known as a khanjar (sometimes called a janbiyyah or jambiya), which is worn tucked in the front waistband.Mealtime serves as the centre of most social gatherings. The typical Omani meal consists of rice, spiced lamb or fish, dates, and coffee or tea. Incensenotably frankincense, which is native to Omanis burned at the end of the meal.Omanis observe the standard Islamic holidays, including the two eids (festivals), Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, as well as several secular holidays, such as National Day (celebrating the expulsion of the Portuguese in the 17th century) and the ruling sultans birthday.The artsOmani artisans are renowned for woodcarving, weaving, and silver- and goldsmithing and for the manufacture of daggers and swords. Their handiworks are among the many items that may be found at the souk, or market, of Muscat, a thriving centre of popular culture. The Ministry of National Heritage and Culture is charged with preserving historic buildings, excavating archaeological sites, and supporting such traditional crafts as weaving and the crafting of silver and gold jewelry. It also promotes Omani literature and has printed an encyclopaedia of Omani heritage. The annual Muscat International Book Fair promotes books from throughout the Arabic-speaking world.Just as attempts have been made to preserve much of traditional society in the midst of development, traditional elements of architecture have been incorporated into new buildings; the result is that Omans cities feel at once contemporary and ancient. The countrys restored forts and castles, the subject of several documentary films, are among the most important historic sites in Oman. Architecturally, particularly significant structures include a series of forts guarding Muscats harbour and several strategic strongholds guarding the interior, most of which date to the 17th century. The most noteworthy of these is Bahl Fort, a stone and mud-brick edifice that dates to the pre-Islamic era and was designated a World Heritage site in 1987. Other sites in Oman enjoying this distinction are the prehistoric settlements at Bt, Al-Khutm, and Al-Ayn (1988); the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary (1994); and the Frankincense Trail (2000), which consists of a series of stops along the ancient trade route.Cultural institutionsOman: Royal Opera House MuscatRoyal Opera House Muscat, Oman.(more)Oman Museum (founded 1974), located outside Muscat, is the countrys foremost cultural repository; it chronicles the countrys history and includes exhibits on Islam. The history of the Omani army is the focus of the Armed Forces Museum (1988). Other institutions include the National Museum (1978), Natural History Museum (1983), Childrens Museum (1990), and Bait Nadir, a converted 18th-century residence that now houses Omani art and traditional items, including jewelry, silverware, pottery, and woodcarvings. The Royal Oman Symphony Orchestra was formed in the late 1980s and has performed with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra; it is one of the few national orchestras in the Middle East.Sports and recreationAl-Binah, Oman: bullfightBullfight in Al-Binah, Oman.(more)Dhow racing is a popular traditional sport, as is camel racing. Bedouin still train most of the camels used for the races, which take place on racetracks and on makeshift courses in the open desert. Arabian horses have long been bred in the country, and racing is a popular spectator sport. Falconry is practiced by the wealthy elite. More-modern activities include sand surfing and waterskiing; football (soccer) and rugby are also widely played. Oman made its first Olympic appearance at the 1984 Summer Games, but the country has not competed at the Winter Games. Omani athletes also participate in the quadrennial Asian Games.Media and publishingIn addition to state-run newspapers, several independent Arabic- and English-language newspapers are published on a daily and weekly basis. Although the government guarantees freedom of the press, it has the right to censor all domestic and imported publications that it considers politically or culturally offensive. The television station is state-run, and radio stations broadcast in both Arabic and English.J.E. PetersonJill Ann CrystalHistoryThis discussion focuses on Oman since the 18th century.

Sufficient housing, in fact, has not traditionally been a high priority of the government, although in 1987 it did establish a National Housing Authority with the goal of developing housing units for the countrys burgeoning low-income population. However, such attempts were abandoned in the 1990s for want of adequate resources. In 2001 a National Housing Policy was approved to review the status of nationwide housing and to identify sources of revenue, land availability, incentives to developers and contractors, and the conditions needed to make construction cost-effective. There are three general classes of housing in Pakistan: pukka houses, built of substantial material such as stone, brick, cement, concrete, or timber; katchi (or kuchha [ramshackle]) houses, constructed of less-durable material (e.g., mud, bamboo, reeds, or thatch); and semi-pukka houses, which are a mix between the two. Housing stocks comprise an equal number of semi-pukka and katchi houses (about two-fifths each), and remaining houses (roughly one-fifth of the total) are the better-variety pukka houses. Urban areas are dominated by ramshackle neighbourhoods known locally as katchi abadis, which can be found in all cities. In such unplanned and unregulated areas, safe drinking water and proper sanitation are rare (as they are in rural areas), and the buildings themselves are often flimsy and unsafe. Throughout the country, roughly half of all urban residents live in such areas. Pakistans housing problem increased dramatically with the devastating 2005 earthquake in the northern regions, where more than half a million houses were destroyed or severely damaged over a vast area. The Pakistani government quickly established the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA), which received funding from the World Bank and a large number of other sources. In addition to constructing new earthquake-resistant houses and reinforcing existing structures, the ERRA is repairing roads and other infrastructure in the region. Massive floods in 2010 destroyed or damaged an estimated 1.7 million houses, forcing millions of Pakistanis to move to temporary shelters.   Education Pakistans literacy rate is substantially lower than that of many developing countries; roughly half of all adults are literate, the literacy rate being significantly higher for males than for females. A substantial proportion of those who are literate, however, have not had any formal education. Educational levels for women are much lower than those for men. The share of females in educational levels progressively diminishes above the primary school level. Education in Pakistan is not compulsory. Since independence Pakistan has increased the number of primary and secondary schools, and the number of students enrolled has risen dramatically. Teacher training has been promoted by the government and by international agencies. Higher education is available at vocational schools, technical schools, and colleges throughout the country. The oldest university is the University of the Punjab (established 1882), and the largest institutions are Allama Iqbal Open University (1974), in Islamabad, the University of Peshawar (1950), and the University of Karachi (1950). Other universities established during the 20th century include Quaid-i-Azam University (1967; called the University of Islamabad until 1976), the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Agricultural University in Peshawar (1981), the International Islamic University in Islamabad (1980), the Aga Khan University in Karachi (1983), and the Lahore University for Management Sciences (1986). Most university classes are taught in Urdu or English. Education suffered a major setback in the 1970s as a result of the nationalization of private schools and colleges. The reversal of that policy in the 1980s led to a proliferation of private institutions, particularly in the large cities. In the 1980s the government also began to focus on the Islamization of the curriculum and the increased use of Urdu as the medium of instruction. During that period there was also an increase in the number of madrassas (Islamic schools) established throughout the country, particularly in poorer areas. (The added incentive of such institutions has been that most are residential schools, providing room and board at no cost in addition to a free education.) Although many of these schools provide good quality education in religious as well as secular subjects, others are simply maktabs (primary schools) that provide no basic education, even for older students, beyond the memorization of scripture; a number of thoseparticularly schools found along the Afghan borderhave been recruiting and training centres for jihadist groups. The more-Westernized segments of the population prefer to send their children to private schools, which continue to offer Western-style education and instruction in English. A number of private schools offer college entrance examinations administered by educational agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom, and many graduates of these schools are educated abroad. The division of the educational system into a private Westernized section and a state-run Islamized section has thus caused social tensions and exacerbated the problem of brain drain, the emigration to the West of many of the better-educated members of the population.   Cultural life mosque of Maryam ZamaniCeiling of the mosque of Maryam Zamani, Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.(more)Pakistan shares influences that have shaped the cultures of South Asia. There are thus wider regional similarities extending beyond the national boundaries; cultural ways in Pakistan are broadly similar to those experienced in large parts of Afghanistan and northern India. This entire region was deeply influenced by the Arabic-Persian culture that arrived with Muslim conquerors beginning roughly a millennium ago. On the other hand, the specific regional cultures of Pakistan present a picture of rich diversity, making it difficult to speak of a single Pakistani culture. Residents of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, for example, lead lives similar to fellow Pashtuns in Afghanistan. In other parts of the country, Urdu-speaking muhajirs brought with them many cultural ways and values found among the Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim populations of northern India. "},{"CountryName":"Palau","CulturalInfo":"Economy of PalauSince the end of World War II, the major employer in Palau has been governmentfirst the U.S. Navy, then the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and finally the government of Palau. Nevertheless, in the rural areas outside Koror the subsistence economy is active. Women typically gather and cultivate taro, sweet potato, and cassava, and men fish and tend pigs, which are used at customary feasts. Nearshore reef fishing is carried out on a subsistence and small-venture basis, but it does not generate significant government revenue. Offshore tuna fishing by foreign vessels provides a small amount of government revenue through the sale of licenses. There are no major exportable crops; tuna and clothing are the countrys main exports. Tourism grew considerably during the late 20th century and has also made some contribution to the republics economic growth. The countrys per capita income is one of the highest in the region. The U.S. dollar is the official currency of Palau, which does not have a central bank. In 1997 the country joined the International Monetary Fund. There is heavy reliance on financial assistance from the United States. Following allegations in 1999 that Palau was the site of money-laundering activities, the government established financial regulatory bodies in the early 21st century and introduced tighter banking regulations. Foreigners, particularly from the Philippines and Taiwan, constitute a growing segment of Palaus labour force. By the early 21st century, foreigners accounted for more than two-fifths of the countrys paid workers. While the constitution allows for the formation of unions, at the start of the 21st century no such organizations existed in Palau. In 1998 the country adopted its first minimum-wage law; the law, however, does not apply to foreign workers. Koror has a system of paved roads. There are stretches of paved road on Babelthuap, and in the mid-1990s construction began on a 53-mile (85-km), two-lane highway. Known as the Compact Road because its construction was a term of the Compact of Free Association, it was  completed in 2007. The roads built in 194446 by U.S. military forces on Peleliu and Angaur are still usable. Transportation between islands is usually by boat or airplane. There is regular commuter service from Koror to Peleliu and Angaur, and trips by speedboat to coastal villages on Babelthuap usually can be completed in a few hours. There is an international airport located on Babelthuap.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tBritannica Quiz\t\tWhich Country Is Larger By Area?

The executive consists of the separately elected offices of president and vice president, the Council of Chiefs to advise the president on traditional laws and customs, and the cabinet. The Olbiil Era Kelulau (National Congress) consists of the Senate and the House of Delegates. Both executive and legislative branches are elected for four-year terms. Voting is open to individuals age 18 and older. The Palau judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, with both trial and appellate divisions, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Land Court. At the local level, each of the 16 traditional settlement areas constitutes a state with an elected governor and legislature. Palau has no armed forces; the United States is responsible for protecting the country. Some Palauans volunteer to serve in the U.S. armed forces. Education is compulsory between ages 6 and 14, or until the student completes the eighth grade. There are public and private elementary and secondary schools, and instruction is given in both English and Palauan. Palau Community College (1993), which provides vocational and academic courses and is open to students from throughout Micronesia, originated as a vocational school in the 1920s, during the Japanese administration. Although there is no higher educational institution in Palau, government scholarships are available to young Palauans wanting to further their education in universities abroad. The country has near-total adult literacy. Health care is provided by the hospital on Koror; field dispensaries and a small number of private clinics supplement services in remote parts of the country. The incidences of mental illness, suicide, and alcoholism in Palau are higher than in most countries.

Palauans adapted to a century of colonial intrusionSpanish, German, Japanese, and Americanby viewing reality as something imposed from the outside to which one must adjust quickly if it is to be manipulated. Reciprocity and redistribution customs carried out between clans exchange food and services for money and gifts at births, house completions, and funerals. Women are the strength of society and control land, money, and titles. Men, previously occupied as fishermen and warriors, continue their traditional tasks in the rural areas and, as an adaptation to modern society, compete for elected office and in business. Etpison MuseumThe Etpison Museum, Koror, Palau.(more)Traditional art forms persist in chants and storyboards, which are now made for sale to tourists rather than for decoration of mens clubhouses. The Belau National Museum (1955) in Koror has a small but instructive collection of artifacts. The Etpison Museum (1999), also located in Koror, has photographs, maps, and cultural artifacts among its collections. Many sporting activities centre on Palaus waters and beaches. Baseball is an increasingly popular sport. For a discussion of the culture in its broader regional and historical context, see Micronesian culture.History Large hillside terraces, numerous stone ruins, and megaliths on Babelthuap give evidence of a vital culture before contact with European explorers. The first extensive contact of Palauans with Westerners took place after the shipwreck of the East India Companys packet Antelope in 1783. George Keates An Account of the Pelew Islands (1788), which recounted the friendship and high adventure found in Palau, served to fuel the European myths of the noble savage and the island paradise. The first 70 years of the 19th century were punctuated by the occasional visits of whalers and traders, who left beachcombers and firearms behind. Diseases communicated by contact with Europeans led to the deaths of many islanders, and firearms were prized for intervillage warfare, which was ended in 1883 through the peaceful intervention of Capt. Cyprian Bridge of HMS Espiegle. Spanish and German colonial influence was expressed through Roman Catholic missionaries. The Japanese navy expelled the Germans at the beginning of World War I, and, although the Japanese period is locally remembered as one of economic development and order, the Palauans were a marginal minority by 1936. Japan lost Palau in World War II in a struggle that was socially destabilizing and confusing to the Palauans. After a short period of administration by the U.S. Navy, Palau became part of the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands under U.S. administration in 1947. A constitution was adopted in 1981 (following two prior referendums), and elections were held in the same year. The country became internally self-governing in 1981. Palau signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States in 1982, but the required number of voters failed to pass the referendum until 1993. The compact required that the United States remain responsible for external security and defense and that it provide financial assistance for Palau, but conflict arose over Palaus constitutional prohibition on the operation of U.S. nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed vessels and aircraft within the jurisdiction of Palau. According to the terms of the compact, the United States reserved this right as well as the right to neither confirm nor deny the presence or absence of such weapons in Palau. Several attempts were made to revise the constitution, revise the compact agreement, and secure Palauan approval, and the United States dissolved the trusteeship in 1986. In 1992 voters approved an amendment that reduced from three-fourths to a simple majority the popular vote required to override the antinuclear provision of the constitution. This cleared the way for approval of the compact in 1993, and under its terms Palau became independent in October 1994. Palau joined the United Nations the following December. In 1985 volatile internal politics resulted in the assassination of the first president, Haruo I. Remeliik. In August 1985 Lazarus E. Salii was elected to serve out the four-year term begun by Remeliik in January 1985, but Saliis term was also cut short, when he committed suicide in August 1988. By the early 1990s, however, Palauan politics had stabilized. In September 1996 the bridge connecting Koror with Babelthuap island collapsed, killing two people and wreaking havoc on the national economy. The capital, cut off from the international airport on Babelthuap, found itself isolated from the rest of the country, as well as from the outside world, and telecommunications, water, and power were disrupted for most of the population. The Japanese government contributed some $25 million for the construction of the replacement Babelthuap-Koror bridgeof a suspension design, rather than a concrete cantilever like the firstwhich was opened in 2002. Palau lent its support to the U.S.-led coalition during the Iraq War, in which Palauan troops served as part of the U.S. military. Donald Raymond Shuster Sophie Foster"},{"CountryName":"Panama","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Panamas culture is a blend of African, American Indian, North American, and Spanish influences, which are expressed in its traditional arts and crafts, music, religion, sports, and cuisine. Panamanian music is popular throughout Latin America, and the country is known as well for its many festivals. Other aspects of traditional culture are well preserved, especially by the countrys Indian peoples. Panama is a cultural melting pot, adapting elements from a wide variety of sources and valuing innovation as much as the good things of the past. Cultural milieu The cosmopolitan urban culture near the canal contrasts with the rural culture of the savannas. The latter area, with its cattle ranches and horsemanship, is a centre of Hispanic tradition. Old folk songs and handicrafts are preserved therefor example, around the towns of Chitr and Las Tablas. Also culturally distinctive are the territories of the various Indian groups, each with its language and handicrafts, such as the bright smocks (molas) decorated with reverse appliqu panels worn by Kuna women and the netted carrying bags made by the Guaym. The Kuna have a strong tradition of storytelling (oral literature), including epic poetry thatwhen written can extend for hundreds or thousands of lines. Other areas of cultural interest include the Caribbean islands of Almirante Bay, with their Antillean customs. Panama Citys Historic District is known for its colonial architecture, which dates to the 17th century. In 1997 the district was designated a World Heritage site, as were the old Caribbean coastal fortifications of Portobelo and San Lorenzo in 1980. Daily life and social customs Panama has adopted elements of food and culture from South and Central America, the Caribbean (including African influences), North America, Asia, and the Middle East. This is especially true in the areas near the canal where more than half the population lives. Caribbean influence is strongest along the northern coast and among the Afro-Panamanian population, many of whom are descended from English-speaking Caribbean families who came to build the canal. U.S. influence is strongest among the urban middle and upper classes; these groups typically speak English as well as Spanish, increasingly use the Internet and cell phones, have greater opportunities to travel abroad, and consume expensive goods brought in from abroad and sold in some of Latin Americas best-appointed shopping centres. Major economic and social inequalities persist, and most Panamanians in isolated rural areas continue to be poor and to have traditional lifestyles. Panamanian food reflects the nations cosmopolitan background, particularly its Colombian, U.S., and Caribbean influences. Rice, beans, and corn are basic staples, and good use is made of seafood and tropical fruits and vegetables. Arroz con pollo and sancocho, two chicken dishes, are considered national favourites. Chiles and the herb culantro flavour many dishes. Also widespread are Panamanian versions of the seviche, tamales, and empanadas found throughout Latin America. Locally produced beers and rum are the most popular alcoholic beverages, but North American brands dominate the soft drink industry. Popular entertainment is also a result of Panamas multicultural heritage. Caribbean rhythms and North American rock are more popular than traditional Hispanic music. Mexican and Venezuelan telenovelas (soap operas) compete with American productions for the television audience. The arts Anthropologists and folklorists have published many Kuna stories and poems, in the process creating one of the best-documented bodies of Native American literature. Apart from Panamas indigenous arts and oral traditions, few artistic achievements were produced in the region prior to independence in 1903. The themes of earlier works were mostly European or church-related. Some progress has been made in national expression since that timeby poets and fiction writers such as Gaspar Octavio Hernndez, Ricardo Mir, and Gloria Guardia, among othersand there has been some international recognition of Panamanian artists. Panamas larger cities are often visited by international musical and theatrical groups and by poets, sculptors, and other artists. Music in Panama is a lively blend of many styles, including salsa, Cuban son, Colombian cumbia, Argentine tango, and Caribbean island ska, reggae, and soca. Common instruments are drums, castanets, bells, mejoranas (five-stringed guitarlike instruments), and flutes. One of Latin Americas best-known musicians is the Panamanian-born salsa singer and actor Rubn Blades, who ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1994. The national dance, the tamborito (little drum), features couples moving to a combination of drumbeats. Cultural institutions Among the countrys cultural institutions are the Panamanian Art Institute (Panarte), the National Institute of Music, the National School of Music, the National School of Plastic Art, the National School of Dance, and the National School of Theatre. Also of note are the National Commission on Archaeology and Historic Monuments, the National Museum of Panama, and the Panamanian Academy of History. The National Institute of Culture promotes many types of events, including concerts, theatre, and art expositions. "},{"CountryName":"Papua-New-Guinea","CulturalInfo":"Security of Papua New GuineaPapua New Guineas principal external security issue concerns its western border, which abuts Indonesian Papua. West Papuan nationalists of the Free Papua Movement (Organisasi Papua Merdeka) have often been in conflict with the Indonesian armed forces. That, in turn, has often led to incursions into Papua New Guinean territory by refugees, rebels, and Indonesian troops pursuing them. The Papua New Guinea Defence Force has stationed small detachments at each end of the largely unmarked north-south border, but the two states have sought to avoid conflict with each other. In the mid-1980s a wave of refugees sought shelter in Papua New Guinea, and it was estimated that in the early 21st century some 10,000 West Papuan refugees remained there. The countrys borders are somewhat porous; firearms have been smuggled from Indonesia and Australia into Papua New Guinea. During the civil warfare over Bougainvilles independence, the waters between Bougainville Island and the Solomon Islands were a major line of communication for the rebels, a channel for weapons and personnel, including medical evacuations. Just before Papua New Guineas independence, following a few decades of peace under the colonial regime, the Highlands region became notorious for interclan disputes that still continue. Those disputes have at times escalated into small-scale warfare, termed tribal fighting, that worsened from the mid-1980s with the replacement of spears, arrows, and axes with shotguns and, later, the introduction of high-powered military assault weapons. Crime rates are high, and, for most Papua New Guineans, the primary security issues are personal and involve fear of crime, be it property theft or interpersonal violent acts, including rape. Security concerns are also a major problem for businesses and are regarded as a serious deterrent to investment, both foreign and local, as well as tourism. The police service is understaffed, poorly trained, and underfunded. As a consequence, private companies have come to play a significant role in security. Papua New Guineas major foreign policy concerns involve managing ties with Australia, the rest of the Pacific Islands region, and the countrys Asian neighbours, especially Indonesia. Relations with the latter have occasionally been strained as a result of nationalist upheavals in Indonesian Papua. In the early 21st century, relations with China were close; China provided direct foreign investment. Immigration of Chinese workersmuch of it illegalwas considerable. Health and welfare Essential services such as safe water supplies, sanitation, and electricity are far from comprehensive in the rapidly growing urban areas and have barely expanded in rural areas since independence. Roughly half of primary health services and of primary schooling are provided by church agencies, with some funding from the government. In several provinces the coverage of primary schools and basic health services has declined since the mid-1980s, due to lack of staff and supplies, a trend exacerbated by the decline of the road network. While Papua New Guineas per capita expenditure on health is relatively high for a developing country, it has not risen in proportion to the rapidly growing population. Provincial hospitals are under pressure, as are the general hospitals, few in number, that serve their neighbouring provinces. In Port Moresby private hospitals serve the elite. In the early 21st century the rate of HIV infection was the highest in the South Pacific and was increasing rapidly, especially in rural areas. Pneumonia, tuberculosis, gastrointestinal diseases, influenza, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were among the leading causes of mortality, especially for small children. Primary health care at the village level is inadequate, and maternal and infant mortality remain high by global and Pacific Islands standards. Immunization rates are low. There is no social security system in Papua New Guinea; the nearest equivalent of welfare support that government typically provides in more-developed countries comes instead from the extended family and fellow villagers, known as wantok (Tok Pisin: one talk or one language). In acute emergencies such as severe droughts, cyclones, and floods, foreign aid has provided food supplies and logistics. Housing houses on stilts, Papua New GuineaHouses on stilts, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.(more)Traditional housing styles reflect environmental circumstances. Examples range from houses dug into the ground to retain heat in the colder parts of the Highlands to stilt dwellings built over the sea in sheltered coastal areas, which help to keep out mosquitoes and simplify sanitation. Such adjustments are disappearing as Western-style housing becomes more common. In isolated areas of the southern interior there still remain some of the previously common giant communal structures that house the male population, with a circling cluster of womens huts. In many coastal areas villages stretch between the beach and an inland swamp in long lines, broken into clan or family segments. In the Highlands numerous village forms exist: in the Eastern Highlands and Chimbu provinces, houses previously clustered along ridgetops for defensive purposes have been moved downslope along the roads; in the Western Highlands and Enga provinces, the traditional form is of scattered households, each surrounded by its own land, with separate houses for men and women; in the Telefomin area, clustered villages are supplemented by scattered garden houses at a distance from the central settlement. Within the towns there are great contrasts in housing. The city of Port Moresby, for example, has grand modern apartment blocks overlooking the sea, but over half its population lives in improvised housing in settlements. Rapid urban growth and considerable income inequalities have meant that public or low-cost housing has not been built in sufficient quantities to accommodate much more than a small portion of those who need it. Education Despite Papua New Guineas policies for universal primary education and the considerable progress it has made since independence in expanding education, schooling remains neither free nor compulsory. At most about two-thirds of school-age children attend school, and some three-fifths of adults are literate; in both cases rates are lower among women and girls than among men and boys. Only about half of those who begin primary school complete all six years, and only one-fourth of those students enroll in secondary school. Even though education is a major priority of government, the rapid growth and extreme youthfulness of the population means that educational demand outstrips supply, and, when an economic choice is necessary, families tend to spend their limited funds to educate sons rather than daughters. The country has four state-run universitiesnotably, the University of Papua New Guinea, in Port Moresbyand two that are church-based, as well as a number of teacher-training institutions and a medical school. Cultural life Cultural milieu and arts Despite the penetration of the contemporary economy and media and the effects thereof on traditional cultural life, Papua New Guinea retains a rich variety of village cultures. These are expressed in the ways the countrys landscapes have been shaped over generations and in its peoples wood carving, storytelling, song, dance, and body decoration. memorial boardMemorial board, wood. From the Sawos people, Sepik central coast, Papua New Guinea, in the Museum of Ethnology, Berlin.(more)Carvings from the Sepik, Gulf, Massim, and Huon Peninsula regions are world famous. The best-known wood carvings come from the Sepik region, notably masks and crocodile figures that have religious connotations. Many sacred carvings from the giant mens houses known as tambaran on the Sepik River have been sold and not replaced amid the decline of tourist traffic in the 21st century. In most areas only the older generations possess the skills for making traditional clay cooking pots, which are being replaced by metal pots and pans. Across the country, wooden hourglass-shaped drums known as kundu remain essential for song and dance, especially during major national celebrations such as the anniversary of independence. Self-decoration, particularly for dance and rituals, remains important everywhere. Traditional musical expression is an essential indicator of local identity, and contemporary shows offer new opportunities for presentation to diverse audiences. The annual shows at Goroka and Mount Hagen involve thousands of dance group participants, and they attract many thousands of spectators from across the country and overseas. In urban areas painting on canvas has become a vibrant cottage industry for local artists that is patronized by tourists, resident expatriates, and the local middle class. A wave of nationalist creative writing was produced during the transition to independence and continues despite occasional periods of diminished activity, but formal theatre declined in the decades after independence. Street theatre sponsored by aid donors is often used in awareness campaigns ranging from electoral training to HIV/AIDS education. The cities, especially, support a vibrant youth music culture; many local bands support a thriving commercial recording industry, and their songs are played on radio and television. "},{"CountryName":"Paraguay","CulturalInfo":" Security of ParaguayParaguays military consists of an army, a navy, and an air force. The 1992 constitution reduced military service (which is compulsory for males aged 18 and older) from 18 to 12 months; conscientious objectors may opt for an alternative to service. During the Stroessner years, all military officials were obliged to become members of the Colorado Party. The 1992 constitution banned all military personnel in active service from belonging to political parties or engaging in any political activity.   Health and welfare Measles, tuberculosis, acute respiratory infections, dysentery, hookworm, and hepatitis are prevalent in Paraguay. Chagas disease and leishmaniasis are endemic, and there have been sporadic outbreaks of the mosquito-borne dengue fever and yellow fever. Although infant mortality rates have declined significantly since the 1960s, they are still higher than those of other South American countries. Malnutrition and limited public health services, especially poor implementation of immunization programs, have led to thousands of preventable deaths, particularly in rural areas, where the health of residents is generally worse than that of their urban counterparts. By 2015 only about two-thirds of Paraguayans had access to safe drinking water, and in general the government has spent little on health care. About four-fifths of Paraguayans do not have health insurance. The state-run Institute of Social Provision (IPS) is funded by contributions from government, employers, and employees. It offers pensions, medical care, and subsidies during illness but reaches only a small percentage of the salaried workers.   Education Basic education is free and, where possible, compulsory for children between ages 7 and 13. Although the official enrollment figures are high, the dropout rate is also high. More than nine-tenths of the population is literate, though functional literacy is probably lower. The two oldest universitiesthe public National University of Asuncin (1890) and the private Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic University (1960)are located in Asuncin, with branches in other towns. Those universities also have specialty schools for engineering, medicine, agriculture, business, and veterinary science. Since the 1990s, the number of private universities had increased, exceeding 60 by the second decade of the 21st century. At least half of all university graduates are female. Government spending on education increased after a 1992 constitutional requirement portioned one-fifth of the governments budget for that purpose. Nevertheless, the number of schools is still insufficient, especially in rural areas, and teaching remains inadequate throughout the country.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu The main characteristic of Paraguayan culture is its fusion of both the Guaran and Spanish traditions. Folklore, the arts, and literature reflect this dual origin. The countrys outstanding handicraft is the production of andut lace, which is thought to represent a combination of 16th-century needle lace-making techniques from Europe with Guaran traditions.  "},{"CountryName":"Peru","CulturalInfo":" Government and society  Constitutional framework Perus political history has been punctuated by numerous military coups and changes of constitution. The 1993 Peruvian constitution, which has since been amended several times, decrees a government headed by a president who is popularly elected to a five-year term and serves as chief of state and head of government. The president can be reelected but is prohibited from serving consecutive terms. The president appoints and presides over the Council of Ministers (Cabinet) and is assisted by the president of the Council of Ministers (in effect, the prime minister, who is also appointed by the president) as well as by two popularly elected vice presidents. Legislative power is vested in the unicameral Congress of the Republic, whose members are popularly elected to five-year terms.   Local government For administrative purposes, the country is divided into 25 regions, which are further divided into departments, provinces, and districts. The regional level of government encompasses regions and departments; provinces, districts, and smaller population centres constitute the levels of local government.   Justice The judiciary comprises the Supreme Court and lower courts and tribunals. The Supreme Court has nationwide jurisdiction and hears appeals from lower-court decisions; it also investigates the conduct of lower-court judges. All Supreme Court judges and some judges of lower courts are appointed by the National Council of the Magistracy. A Constitutional Court exists to review any challenges concerning the constitutionality of laws and acts of government. Members of the Constitutional Court are elected by Congress and serve five-year terms.   Political process Voting is compulsory for all citizens ages 1870. A wide spectrum of political partiesranging from right-wing conservative to left-wing socialist and communistparticipate in the political process, including the Nationalist Party United Peru (left-wing), the Peruvian Aprista Party (formerly left-wing but now moderate centre), and National Unity (right-wing). Traditional parties have been supplanted in many elections by hastily formed coalitions. For example, the winner of the 1990 presidential contest, Alberto Fujimori, created a new party expressly for that election. A law passed in 2003 requires that women constitute at least 30 percent of all candidates on party lists. In the early 21st century, women held slightly more than one-fourth of the seats in Congress.   Security Perus military is composed of army, navy, air force, and marine contingents. Service is selective, and men 18 years of age and older are required to register with the government. Peruvian troops have served as United Nations Peacekeeping Forces on numerous missions.   Health and welfare Numerous public agencies in Peru are involved with national health and social security. The government has invested heavily in the construction and equipping of new hospitals and clinics throughout the country. Nevertheless, there is a shortage of doctors, nurses, and health care facilities, particularly outside the Lima urban area, and the country faces a difficult path to adequate health service for its population. Sanitation is another major problem, with most cities lacking adequate sewerage as well as street lighting and paving.   Housing Lima: homesColourful homes on a hillside in Lima, Peru.(more)Housing in Peru varies immensely, with single-family dwellings, high-rise apartment buildings, and informal squatter settlements all found within the country. The type of dwelling is dependent upon variables such as economic and social status of residents and location. Peru has a serious shortage of housing units, especially in the urban squatter settlements but also in the countryside. Large neighbourhoods of the countrys poorer residents are found around the margins of Lima and other Peruvian cities. Often these areas begin as squatter settlements, with families invading vacant land on the periphery of urban areas. Over time, crude huts of cardboard or cane mats are replaced by adobe houses, which in turn are later replaced by two- and three-story homes made from brick and concrete. Such amenities as running water, sewers, electricity, sidewalks, and paved streets are added only gradually; it may take 20 to 30 years for a neighbourhood to become fully developed. Each familys dwelling also develops at its own pace, depending on individual financial situations and decisions. Thus, one house may remain at the initial stage of development while neighbours complete their homes with brick and concrete.   Education Perus educational system is challenged by the steadily increasing percentage of young people in its population. Thus, the state must spend a disproportionate share of its resources on education, which is free and compulsory for all children between ages 6 and 15. Compulsory education is difficult to enforce, however, especially outside urban centres. Because of extremely large class sizes, inadequate facilities, and poorly trained teachers, the quality of education received by children in public schools is regarded as low. As a result, most middle- and upper-class parents send their children to private schools. Universities in Peru include such large, high-calibre institutions as the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, the University of Lima, and the National University of San Marcos, which was founded in 1551 and claims to be the oldest university in South America. There are also a number of provincial universities funded by the government, as well as many private institutions of higher education.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu The complex ethnic and cultural mixture of Peru presents an entwining of aboriginal pantheism, Spanish mysticism, and African religious practices, manifested in the countrys music, literature, textiles, handicrafts, gold and silver work, and bounteous cuisine.  "},{"CountryName":"Philippines","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life  Cultural milieu Philippine society is a unique blend of diversity and homogeneity. Although geographically part of Southeast Asia, the country is culturally strongly Euro-American. Forces of assimilation have constantly worked to overcome cultural differences between the various ethnic groups that are scatteredsometimes in relative isolationthroughout the archipelago. Nearly four centuries of Western rule, however, have left an indelible imprint on the Philippines, serving as a conduit for the introduction of Western culture and as the catalyst for the emergence of a sense of Philippine political and cultural unity. While the Christian churches built by the Spanish and the mosques built by the Muslims provided a spiritual anchor, the educational system established by the United States and expanded by the Filipinos has become emblematic of cultural unity and socioeconomic progress. Nonetheless, through the persistence of strong family ties, the revival of the barangay as the smallest unit of government, increased attention to Asian history and literature, and subsequent revival of dormant traditions, the Philippines has strengthened its Asian heritage without abandoning its Western cultural acquisitions.   Daily life and social customs Life in the Philippines generally revolves around the extended family, including parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins (up to several times removed), and other relatives. For Catholic families, godparentsthose to whom care of children is entrusted should the parents die or otherwise be incapacitatedalso figure prominently in the kinship network. Members of extended families typically gather for major life events such as baptisms and confirmations (for Catholic Filipinos), circumcisions (for Muslim Filipinos), and marriages, as well as for major religious and other national holidays. Among the religious holidays officially observed in the Philippines are Christmas and Easter, as well as Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Other major holidays include New Years Day, Labor Day (May 1), and Independence Day (June 12). Whether festival fare or everyday food, major meals in most Filipino societies are built around boiled or steamed rice or rice noodles. Small amounts of meat, including chicken, pork (in non-Muslim communities), goat, or fish complement the rice or noodle core, along with an assortment of fruits and cooked vegetables. Assorted alcoholic drinks are made from coconut sap, sugarcane, and rice. Balut, a parboiled embryonic duck still in the egg, is a popular street food in the Manila area. Although slacks, shirts, skirts, and dresses based on European designs are common throughout the Philippines, some garments are unique to particular groups or regions. The malong, a colourful woven tube of cloth that can be worn in a variety of ways by both men and women, is characteristic of Muslim communities in Mindanao. In the urban areas, many men wear an intricately embroidered shirt, the barong, for casual and formal events. On special occasions, urban women may wear the terno, a long dress characterized by broad butterfly sleeves that rise slightly at the shoulders and extend about to the elbow. Many of the smaller ethnic groups have characteristic attire for events of special cultural significance.   The arts Early Spanish chroniclers testified that the Filipinos carved the images of their anitos (gods and goddesses) and ancestors in wood. They also played a variety of musical instruments, including end-blown flutes, nose flutes, jews harps, gongs, drums, and lutes, among others. Various seasonal celebrations (e.g., harvest) and life rituals (e.g., courtship and marriage) called for certain instrumental music, songs, and dances. For instance, in some of the Muslim communities of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, the kulintang ensemble, consisting of a set of gongs suspended horizontally and vertically and a single-headed drum, can still be heard at festive events. Although the community of practitioners of rural performing arts has been diminishing, efforts have been under way to revive as well as recontextualize some of the indigenous traditions so that they resonate with an increasingly cosmopolitan Philippine society. Some of the local dance traditions have been preserved or reinterpreted by contemporary performing groups such as Bayanihan (the national folk dance company of the Philippines), established in the mid-20th century, as well as by the Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group and Ballet Philippines. A growing number of world music artists, such as Joey Ayala, have been creating innovative syntheses of indigenous Philippine traditionssuch as kulintangand popular music form. Many Filipino musicians have risen to prominence in the Western classical music tradition, including the composer and conductor Antonio J. Molina, the composer Felipe P. de Leon (known for his nationalistic themes), and the opera singer Jovita Fuentes. The Cultural Center of the Philippines, the Folk Arts Theater, and the restored Manila Metropolitan Theatre (all in Manila) provide homes for the performing arts, featuring local and foreign opera and ballet. To encourage the development of arts, the government gives awards of recognition and maintains a National Arts Center (established 1976), which includes the Philippine High School for the Arts in Los Baos, south of Manila. Filipino painters have included Juan Luna, whose agitated works helped inspire a sense of Filipino nationalism in the late 19th century; Fernando Amorsolo, who is known for his traditional rural scenes; the muralists Carlos V. Francisco and Vicente Manansala; and the modernists Victorio Edades and Arturo Rogerio Luz. Among sculptors, Guillermo Tolentino and Napoleon Abueva are prominent. Rural artists from mountainous regions in northern Luzon and craftsmen living northwest of Manila and in Paete on the eastern shore of Laguna de Bay are known for wood carvings. Romblon and other nearby islands are noted for their marble sculptures. Notable Filipino architects include Juan F. Nakpil, Otilio Arellano, Fernando Ocampo, Leandro Locsin, Juan Arellano, Carlos Arguelles, and Tomas Mapua. Jos RizalThe outspoken political novels of nationalist leader Jos Rizal were Philippine literary landmarks of the late 19th century, and the work of Nick Joaquin has been among the most highly acclaimed Philippine literature since the mid-20th century. The diverse cultural heritage of the country not only animates most of Joaquins fiction writing, but it is also central to his nonfiction work. Among the most celebrated of Joaquins works are his play A Portrait of an Artist as a Filipino (1966) and his biography of assassinated presidential candidate Benigno Aquino, The Aquinos of Tarlac: An Essay on History as Three Generations (1983). Spanish was the prinicipal literary medium until the end of the 19th century, before yielding to English after U.S. occupation. Since independence an increasing number of writers have been composing their works in Filipino or Tagalog. Filipinos have a tradition rich in local and regional lore. Myths and legends deal with such subjects as the origin of the world, the first man and woman on earth, why the sky is high, why the sea is salty, and why there are different races. Other tales are associated with the Spanish conquest. On the island of Mindanao an epic known as the Darangen (To Narrate in Song) depicts the historical and mythological world of the Maranao community, while in northern Luzon the Ilocano epic Biag ni Lam-ang (Life of Lam-ang) recounts the exploits of a traditional folk hero. The Philippines has produced a handful of internationally acclaimed films, including Himala (1982), which recounts the adventures of a young miracle worker; Oro, Plata, Mata (1982), the story of two noble families on the island of Negros during World War II; and Small Voices (2002), the tale of a teacher in an impoverished rural community who, through music, inspires her students to shed their cynicism. Despite its successes, the film industry in the Philippines has remained small, its growth hindered by escalating production costs, high taxes, uncontrolled piracy of videotapes and CDs, and the popularity of foreign films over local productions.   Cultural institutions The National Museum in Manila, which houses a substantial ethnographic collection, is the principal government vehicle for preservation and conservation of the countrys tangible and intangible cultural property. Many of the provinces have established their own museums dedicated to local history and tradition. A few institutions of higher educationsuch as the University of Santo Tomas, Silliman University in eastern Negros, Mindanao State University in Lanao del Sur, and the University of the Philippines at Dilimanlikewise have added museums to their campuses. The National Library serves as a repository for Philippine literary materials and supervises public libraries throughout the country. A number of locations in the Philippines have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites. These include four 16th-century churches built by the Spanish in Manila, Santa Maria, Paoay, and Miag-ao (collectively designated in 1993), the 16th-century trading town of Vigan (1999) in northwestern Luzon, and the ancient rice terraces of the northern Luzon cordilleras (1995). Local nongovernmental organizations such as the Heritage Conservation Society and some historical groups have also sought to preserve the local heritage.  "},{"CountryName":"Poland","CulturalInfo":" Health and welfare Health care in Poland has been handled largely by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, which oversees the health departments of the regional governments. Facilities include clinics; hospitals; sanatoriums, rest homes, and spas; and ambulance services. Private medical and dental practices proliferated after the fall of communism, and the pharmaceutical industry also was privatized. In general, the health care system was in a state of transition during the 1990s, and medical services were seriously strained during periods of general economic crisis. In 1999 the government launched a major reform of the universal health care system. Under communism, social insurance for health services provided for free treatment for all workers and the members of their families, as well as for pensioners, invalids, students, and others. In addition, there was a social service whose purpose was to ensure a suitable means of support for the elderly and invalids. Services for the unemployed were established as a part of the 198990 economic reforms. During the mid-1990s, however, a number of laws were enacted that reduced the formerly comprehensive coverage of the unemployment program. In 19902000 the incidence of many diseases, including measles, mumps, venereal disease, and salmonella infections, fell precipitously, but other diseases, such as influenza and mental and behavioral disorders, rose during this period.   Housing As a result of the program of urbanization that began in the 1940s, Polish cities became overwhelmed by migrant workers from the countryside, and the demand for housing vastly exceeded supply. In urban areas, various cooperative housing schemes were put into operation by the local government authorities, but the standard apartment was inadequate for many families. As a result of the low priority placed on the creation of housing during communist rule, housing shortages were extreme in the 1980s and 90s. In postcommunist Poland private ownership of housing increased significantly. In 2001 some 106,000 dwellings were completed, slightly more than were built in the five-year period from 1991 to 1995 (101,000).   Education Schools of all types and on all levels are free; the system of schooling is standard; and attendance from age 7 to 18 is compulsory. The system, reformed in 1999, contains nursery, primary (six grades), and secondary schools. There are two levels of secondary schools, the gimnazjum (grades 7 through 9) and the liceum (two to four additional years). Several types of the upper-level secondary schools offer vocational training, technical training, and general college-preparatory education. In general, all schools are subject to the Ministry of National Education, but medical schools and colleges are subject to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, army colleges to the Ministry of National Defense, and higher schools of art to the Ministry of Culture and Arts. A substantial number of private schools of all levels (including colleges) emerged in the 1980s and 90s. Prominent universities include the University of Warsaw (founded 1818), the Jagiellonian University (1364) in Krakw, Adam Mickiewicz University (1919) in Pozna, and the Catholic University of Lublin (1918; from 1945 to 1989 the only private university in the Soviet bloc). The highest academic institution is the Polish Academy of Sciences, which has numerous research institutes and represents Polish learning abroad.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Jasna Gra monastery, Czstochowa, PolandVisitors at the Jasna Gra monastery, a popular pilgrimage site, in Czstochowa, Poland.(more)The culture of Poland has been nurtured by a great variety of folk traditions, with influences and borrowings from France, Scandinavia, Russia, and, more recently, the United States. Polands strong connections to the Roman Catholic Church, dating to the 10th century, brought it into close orbit with western Europe. This gave Poland access to cultural developments that had a lesser impact on some of its neighbours. Unlike Russia, Poland was deeply immersed in all the great movements of Western culturesuch as humanism, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and Romanticismand its cultural identity was already strong before the series of partitions of Polish territory began in 1772. Because of its loss of political independence, Poland in the 19th and 20th centuries was characterized by an unrelenting struggle to preserve its national culture and values from foreign impositions and government policy. The Roman Catholic Church in Poland has played a social and cultural role far beyond the religious sphere. After World War II and the arrival of state socialism, catechism lessonsconducted with great zeal in the parishesexposed children to a nonofficial view of the world. Church-sponsored societies, such as the Catholic Intellectual Clubs, provided adults with a unique forum for free public discussion. Parish halls provided shelter for a wide variety of uncensored exhibitions, plays, films, and meetings. And the work and example of St. Pope John Paul II lent support to the popular movement that resulted in Polands transition from a communist satellite to an independent democratic nation in the last years of the 20th century.  "},{"CountryName":"Portugal","CulturalInfo":" Political process All citizens at least age 18 are eligible to vote. Voters directly elect the president, who serves a five-year term, and members of the Assembly of the Republic. Elections to the Assembly of the Republic must occur at least once every four years; seats are apportioned to parties (voters cast ballots for party lists rather than for individual candidates) on the basis of proportional representation in multiseat constituencies. Although Portugal utilizes a proportional system, two parties are dominant: the centre-left Socialist Party (Partido Socialista) and the centre-right Social Democratic Party (Partido Social Democrata). There are also several minor parties, including the conservative Popular Party (Partido Popular) and communist and ecologist parties. Voters (including EU citizens living in Portugal) also elect deputies to the European Parliament, the EUs legislative body. Women, who were first granted the right to vote in Portugal in 1931 (though the franchise then was limited to women with university degrees or secondary-school qualifications), have made great strides in postrevolutionary Portugal, regularly constituting about one-quarter of the members of the Assembly of the Republic.   Security The Portuguese military is commanded by the president, who also appoints the chiefs of staff. Formerly, military service was compulsory, but conscription was eliminated in the early 21st century. The armed forces consist of an army, an air force, and a navy. Before passage of the National Defense Law in 1982, the military had veto power over legislation affecting it, including expenditures and international agreements. Portugal was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949, and it is also a member of the Western European Union, which serves to coordinate European defense and security policies. The Portuguese police are divided into four categories. The Public Security Police (Polcia de Segurana Pblica; PSP) and the Republican National Guard (Guarda Nacional Republicana; GNR) are under the control of the Ministry of Internal Administration. The GNR includes the road police and has jurisdiction over rural areas. The PSP patrols urban areas and directs city traffic. The Fiscal Guard (Guarda Fiscal), which is stationed at frontier crossings and points of entry and is responsible for collecting import duties and investigating smuggling and other violations of border regulations, is under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. There is also a judicial police force, the Polcia Judiciria. The crime rate in Portugal is low, and the decriminalization of virtually all drugs in 2001 made Portugal a test case for law-enforcement agencies around the world. With rates of addiction down and rehabilitation programs replacing incarceration, the Portuguese experiment was widely heralded as a bold response to a pressing public health issue.   Health and welfare The Portuguese welfare system is composed of several types of institutions that insure workers against sickness, disability, and old age and provide for the payment of pensions and family allowances. Compulsory insurance is provided by employers in most sectors of business and industry; employees also pay into the fund. Trade-union provident funds and welfare funds for other employees provide assistance for most categories of workers, and there are voluntary mutual assistance associations and provident institutions for the military forces and civil servants. Many large companies maintain their own welfare and sickness benefit programs and pensions for their employees. Portugal has both public and private hospitals. Major hospitals are generally located in the main district capitals, and other hospitals are found in smaller centres. There are also several hundred other health centres. Charity hospitals (santas casas da misericrdia), which were first founded in 1498 when the Irmandade da Misericrdia (Fraternity of Mercy) was formed in Lisbon by Leonor de Lencastre, the widow of King John II, are funded by a national lottery and play an important social role, especially among the elderly. Special institutions include a cancer hospital and research unit in Lisbon, a school of tropical medicine, and a modern rehabilitation centre for people with disabilities near Lisbon. The health care system was long undermined by inefficiency, funding shortfalls, and a shortage of doctors, though, beginning in the 1990s, the government began to address the systems endemic problems. A major reform of the health care system was undertaken in 2002 with the goal of reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Key challenges for Portugals national health service in the 21st century included balancing the needs of an aging populace with the costs associated with providing the necessary care.   Housing Article 65 of Portugals constitution proclaims that all citizens have a right to a dwelling of adequate size satisfying standards of hygiene and comfort and preserving personal and family privacy. It further requires the government to establish housing policies that are based on urban planning that secures the existence of an adequate network of transport and social facilities and to create a system of rents compatible with family incomes and of individual ownership of dwellings. Nevertheless, particularly in urban areas, Portugal has suffered from substandard housing and severe housing shortages. Dwelling size is small by European standards. However, the rate of home ownership is fairly high, some two-thirds of dwellings being owner-occupied (a marked increase from 1970, when only about half were owner-occupied), and comparatively few owner-occupied homes carry mortgages (though the proportion of mortgages has increased as home ownership has grown). In rural areas the situation was no better, and many places were not electrified until the 1990s. During the 1980s, shantytowns consisting of several hundred thousand dwellings (many of which were unsafe) were constructed on the outskirts of metropolitan areas, particularly Lisbon and Porto. The government began to address poor housing conditions in the 1990s, when it adopted measures to increase and improve the housing stock for less-affluent people. Overall, property values are high, and some of the most desirable apartments are those in residential blocks built in the riverside area east of Lisbon that was cleared in the late 1990s for the Worlds Fair (Expo 98).   Education Early education for children age 3 to 6 is available for free, and schooling is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 18. Education has become a high priority of government funding, particularly since the late 1980s, when a study found that one-fifth of the population over age l5 was illiterate. By the beginning of the 21st century, the literacy rate exceeded 90 percent, and nearly every child was enrolled in school; however, failure rates remain high, and child labour, prevalent especially in the north, has not yet been eliminated. Private schools supplement the state schools, which provide free education for the majority of people. There are several public and private universities, including the long-established University of Coimbra (originally founded in Lisbon in 1290, relocated permanently to Coimbra in 1537), the University of Lisbon (founded 1911), the Technical University of Lisbon (founded 1930), the University of Porto (founded 1911), and the Portuguese Catholic University (founded in 1968 in Lisbon). There are also technical institutes, nursing and technical health schools, military academies, and several specialized schools for subjects such as the sciences and hotel management.   Cultural life Temple of DianaRoman temple, known as the Temple of Diana, in vora, Portugal.(more)Pena PalacePena Palace, Sintra, Portugal.(more)Portuguese culture is based on a past that dates from prehistoric times into the eras of Roman and Moorish invasion. All have left their traces in a rich legacy of archaeological remains, including prehistoric cave paintings at Escoural, the Roman township of Conimbriga, the Roman temple (known as the Temple of Diana) in vora, and the typical Moorish architecture of such southern towns as Olho and Tavira. Throughout the centuries Portugals arts have been enriched by foreign influences, including Flemish, French, and Italian. The voyages of the Portuguese explorers, such as Ferdinand Magellan, who was the first to circumnavigate the globe, and Vasco da Gama, who pioneered an eastern route to Asia around the Cape of Good Hope (the first European to sail around the cape was another Portuguese navigator, Bartolomeu Dias, in 1488), opened the country to Asian influences, and the revelation of Brazils wealth of gold and jewels fed the Baroque flame in decoration. There have been considerable efforts to conserve architecture and art across the country, especially religious artifacts, palaces, and the several distinctive styles of casas portuguesas, or modest homes. Preservation has led to the declaration of the city centres of vora, Sintra, Porto, and, in the Azores, Angra do Herosmo as UNESCO World Heritage sites. "},{"CountryName":"Qatar","CulturalInfo":" Government and society  Constitutional framework A constitutional emirate with one advisory body, Qatar is ruled by a hereditary emir from the l Thn. Members of the ruling family hold almost all the major ministerial posts, which are appointed by the emir. The family, however, is large and fragmented. As oil revenues rose after World War II, contention within the ruling family grew, and there have been several bloodless palace coups. The emirs power is constrained by the need to maintain the support of important family members, many of whom occupy high governmental posts. The homogeneity of the ruling family and the countrys wealth contribute to Qatars political stability. The emir has also cautiously expanded political participation, allowing the first municipal elections to take place in 1999, with an electorate that included both female and male Qataris. Under a provisional constitution enacted in 1972, the emir ruled in consultation with a Council of Ministers (Majlis al-Wuzar) and an appointed Advisory Council (Majlis al-Shr). A new constitution, which was approved by referendum in 2003 and enacted in 2005, provided for the popular election of two-thirds of the members of the Advisory Council.   Justice Qatars legal system has several sources: the Sharah (Islamic law), Ottoman law, and European civil and (to a lesser extent) common law. The latter was introduced through the borrowing of codes of other European-influenced Arab states. Personal status law is governed largely by the Sharah, while criminal law is influenced but not governed by it. In addition to a Higher Judicial Council, there are also several lower courts and a system of appeals courts. The emir sometimes acts as the final court of appeal. Formal civil and criminal codes were introduced in the 1970s.   Political process There are no political parties in Qatar. Qataris have been allowed to vote in municipal elections since 1999, and the first parliamentary election was held in 2021.

The countrys military expenditure as a percentage of GDP, however, is high: five times the world average, more than almost any other countrys.

(more)Education is free but not compulsory for all citizens between the ages of 6 and 16. Classes are segregated by sex. Qatar spends generously on education, having one of the highest per-pupil expenditures in the world. Its system has expanded rapidly. Two teacher-training faculties, one for men and one for women, were established in 1973, and together they were given university status, as the University of Qatar, in 1977. The university has continued to expand, and a new campus was completed in Doha in 1985. Interest in establishing Qatar as a major regional research hub led to the foundation of Education City, a multi-university facility located on the outskirts of Doha. By the early 21st century several American institutions had branches in Education City, including Virginia Commonwealth University, Weill Cornell Medical College (part of Cornell University), Carnegie Mellon University, Texas AM University, Northwestern University, and Georgetown University. The universities offered programs such as premedical and medical studies, business administration, chemical, electrical, and mechanical engineering, journalism, and fine arts. The government also provides adult education classes in schools and centres throughout the country, with an emphasis on increasing adult literacy. About four-fifths of the countrys population is literate, with roughly equal proportions of males and females.   Cultural life  Daily life and social customs Qatar: traditional dressQatari men in traditional dress at a hawk market.(more)The Qatari people are descendants of Bedouin and have maintained a tradition of generous hospitality. Qatari society, however, tends to be conservative in most respects and is heavily influenced by Islamic customs. The consumption of alcohol, for example, is frowned upon, although alcohol may be served in a limited number of hotels catering mainly to foreigners. Likewise, dress is generally traditional and conservative. Qatari Arab men usually dress in a flowing white shirt (thawb) and a head scarf (kaffiyeh) held in place by a cord (iql). Dress for Qatari women, although still conservative, is much less formal than in neighbouring Saudi Arabia. Many women still wear the full length black cloak (abyah), generally over Western clothing, but others simply wear the veil (ijab). Their traditional dress is often decorated with gold or silver embroidery. In public the sexes are customarily separated.

The traditional Bedouin arts of weaving (mostly rugs and pillows), poetry, and singing are still practiced. A genre of music known as nahmah (shanty), once popular among pearl divers in Qatar and the broader Persian Gulf region, virtually disappeared with the decline of the pearling industry, although the Qatari government has made great efforts to preserve it. Arab, Pakistani, Indian, and other expatriate workers have brought their musical styles to the country, but Qatari youth listen more to Western and Arab popular music than to Bedouin or other traditional forms.   Cultural institutions The National Museum of Qatar, designed by Jean Nouvel and inaugurated in March 2019, takes visitors through interactive exhibits that feature 700 million years of Qatari history.

Sports and recreation Doha, Qatar: 2006 Asian GamesTorch of the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar.(more)Qatars sports culture blends the traditional sports of Arabias desert society with contemporary sports of Western origin. Popular traditional sports include Arabian horse racing, camel racing, and falconry, all rooted in the countrys nomadic past. Western sports such as basketball, golf, handball, football (soccer), swimming, table tennis, track, and volleyball are practiced widely, but primarily by the expatriate population; football is overwhelmingly the most popular of these. In 2010 it was announced that Qatar would be the site of the finals of the World Cup football competition in 2022, making it the first Middle Eastern country scheduled to host the event. The country also hosts several annual sporting events, of which tennis, golf, and automobile racing are the most notable. The Qatar National Sport Federation, founded in 1961, serves as an organizing body for sports education. Qatar made its Olympic debut at the 1984 Summer Games; the country has never participated in the Winter Games.   Media and publishing Government-owned radio and television stations broadcast in Arabic, English, French, and Urdu. Satellite television transmissions from outside the country are easily accessible through local providers, and Qatar receives radio broadcasts from the neighbouring Gulf states and from such international broadcasters as the BBC World Service. In 1996 media restrictions in Qatar were relaxedthe countrys press is among the freest in the regionand that year Al Jazeera, a satellite television network, was founded by a member of the ruling family. The outspoken news channel is received throughout much of the Muslim world and has become one of the most popular stations in the Middle East, as well as one of the most important sources of news in a region where there is little toleration for a free press. It became internationally known in 2001 after broadcasting several speeches and interviews of the militant Islamist Osama bin Laden. Several local daily newspapers and weekly publications are also available in Qatar.  "},{"CountryName":"Romania","CulturalInfo":" Political process There is universal suffrage for all citizens age 18 and over. Before the 1989 revolution, the Communist Party of Romania was enshrined as the only legal political party and the leading force in Romanian society. The 1991 constitution replaced single-party rule with a democratic and pluralist system, but former communists have maintained prominence in politics through the formation of such parties as the Social Democratic Party (Partidul Social Democrat; PSD). Parties dating from before World War II have been revived, notably the National Liberal Party (Partidul Naional Liberal; PNL) and the National Peasant Party (Partidul Naional rnesc; PNT), which with smaller anticommunist parties formed the Democratic Convention of Romania (Convenia Democrat Romn; CDR). The Democratic Liberal Party (Partidul Democrat-Liberal; PDL) emerged as a new centrist party in the early 21st century. There are also parties representing environmentalists, Romanian nationalists, Romanias Hungarian minority, and the Roma.   Security The Romanian police force is organized nationally under the Ministry of Administration and Interior. There is a national police force, a national gendarmerie (the military branch of the national police), and a border police force. Serious crimes are prosecuted by the Ministry of Justice. Beginning in 1989, Romania sought to become part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In January 1994 it became the first eastern European country to join NATOs Partnership for Peace program, but there was widespread disappointment in 1999 when Romania was denied entry into NATO. In preparation for membership, Romania, which occupies a strategic location on the Black Sea, was required to sign friendship treaties with its neighbours. Romanian troops were deployed to Afghanistan in 2002 as part of the International Security Assistance Force, and the following year Romania joined the U.S.-led coalition that occupied Iraq. In 2004 Romania was admitted to NATO.   Health and welfare During communist rule, medical care was provided free by the state, and public funds were allotted also to pensions and health resorts for children and workers. The quality of medical service improved with the training of more doctors and the construction of hospitals in the main towns and as a result of the new drugs that became available from the countrys growing pharmaceutical industry. Since the early 1970s, life expectancy for Romanians has increased slightly; however, it is still lower than most other countries in central and eastern Europe, with the exception of most of the countries of the former Soviet Union. Medical services suffered from the austerity program of the 1980s, when priority was given to the repayment of foreign debts. The number of doctors and dentists per capita, which had risen rapidly from 1970 to 1985, failed to keep pace with the growth of population. Ancillary staff actually decreased between 1985 and 1990. Medical treatment for the elderly was also restricted during the latter years of the Ceauescu era. Severe inflation, the difficulties of an economy in transition, and the governments concomitant lack of resources to address the impoverished national health service greatly affected the health care system during the 1990s. The practice of giving underweight babies microtransfusions of unscreened blood resulted in large numbers of them testing positive for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), which causes AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). By the beginning of the 21st century, the transmission of the virus from mother to child was the main cause of the spread of the virus. This period also marked changes in the provision of health care, as private medical and pharmaceutical practices started to slowly emerge, though the majority of hospitals are still state-owned. A bill that would have increased privatization in the health care system was proposed in early 2012, but widespread protests led to the rescinding of the proposal and the collapse of the government of Prime Minister Emil Boc. Under communist rule, in order to keep up population growth, abortion and contraception were made illegal, and large numbers of unwanted children were placed in orphanages. The appalling conditions in these orphanages attracted the attention of many international charities and adoption agencies; however, Romanias lack of resources coupled with unclear policies and inconsistent legislation delayed a solution to the problem of Romanian orphans and street children. Since the 1990s the conditions have generally improved in Romanias state-run orphanages (of which there were more than 200 in the early 21st century). Moreover, in 2004, as a way to end corruption in the system, the Romanian government passed a child welfare law prohibiting international adoption of Romanian orphans.   Housing Since 1991 a significant number of new homes have been constructed throughout the country. Much of the housing boom was propelled by the emergence of a real-estate market and an accumulation of wealth due to a free-market economy. Most of the income was spent on single family homes in the suburbs of Bucharest and on second homes and villas in rural areas. Typical housing for peasants in rural villages is a one- or two-room hut built of locally available materials: wood, stone, wattle, or mud with stucco covering.   Education Throughout the communist period, education in Romania was strictly controlled by the state and reflected the countrys official socialist ideology. Following the revolution, private education was permitted, but it was largely restricted to higher education. Under the Ministry of Education, schooling is generally compulsory through age 16, and more than nine-tenths of the population is literate. Higher education is provided by universities, polytechnical schools, vocational schools, and other institutes. University study traditionally lasts four to six years, depending on the particular discipline, and is modeled on the French system, with large lecture halls. Criticism of this system and interest in more student-teacher interaction attracted some students to the various private universities that were established after 1989. Nevertheless, most students attend state-run universities. The major Romanian universities are the University of Bucharest (1864), the Technical University of Iai (1937), and the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (1948). The largest technical university in Romania is the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, founded in 1818 as the National School of Bridges, Roads, and Mines. Other polytechnic universities are found in the cities of Braov, Craiova, Oradea, Suceava, and Timioara. There are also public schools that cater to national minorities. The Babe-Bolyai University (1956), in Cluj-Napoca, is a multicultural university, offering courses in Romanian, Hungarian, German, and Romany.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Romanian folk dancersRomanian folk dancers performing at a folk festival.(more)Each geographic region in Romania has its own culture, which reflects and is the product of regional history. Transylvania and the Banat were ruled for many centuries by Austria and Hungary, and their architecture reflects Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque styles. Moldavia, in eastern Romania, has a culture that reflects its proximity to Ukraine and Russia, though traces of Tatar and other Central Asian influences have been identified in its folk art. The loggia, an open-air porch that evolved in the Mediterranean, was first incorporated into homes in Romania in Walachia. The region also traditionally absorbed influences from the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic Middle East. The Hungarian, German, and Roma minorities, who are scattered throughout the country, maintain their own traditions, which are reflected in their folk arts, cuisine, and dress.  "},{"CountryName":"Russia","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life  The development of Russian culture Russias unique and vibrant culture developed, as did the country itself, from a complicated interplay of native Slavic cultural material and borrowings from a wide variety of foreign cultures. In the Kievan period (c. 10th13th century), the borrowings were primarily from Eastern Orthodox Byzantine culture. During the Muscovite period (c. 14th17th century), the Slavic and Byzantine cultural substrates were enriched and modified by Asiatic influences carried by the Mongol hordes. Finally, in the modern period (since the 18th century), the cultural heritage of western Europe was added to the Russian melting pot.  The Kievan period Although many traces of the Slavic culture that existed in the territories of Kievan Rus survived beyond its Christianization (which occurred, according to The Russian Primary Chronicle, in 988), the cultural system that organized the lives of the early Slavs is far from being understood. From the 10th century, however, enough material has survived to provide a reasonably accurate portrait of Old Russian cultural life. High culture in Kievan Rus was primarily ecclesiastical. Literacy was not widespread, and artistic composition was undertaken almost exclusively by monks. The earliest circulated literary works were translations from Greek into Old Church Slavonic (a South Slavic dialect that was, in this period, close enough to Old Russian to be understandable). By the 11th century, however, monks were producing original works (on Byzantine models), primarily hagiographies, historical chronicles, and homilies. At least one great secular work was produced as well: the epic The Song of Igors Campaign, which dates from the late 12th century and describes a failed military expedition against the neighbouring Polovtsy. Evidence also exists (primarily in the form of church records of suppression) of a thriving popular culture based on pre-Christian traditions centring on harvest, marriage, birth, and death rituals. The most important aspects of Kievan culture for the development of modern Russian culture, however, were not literary or folkloric but rather artistic and architectural. The early Slavic rulers expressed their religious piety and displayed their wealth through the construction of stone churches, at first in Byzantine style (such as the 11th-century Cathedral of St. Sophia, which still stands in Kiev, Ukraine) and later in a distinctive Russian style (best preserved today in churches in and around the city of Vladimir, east of Moscow). The interiors of many of these churches were ornately decorated with frescoes and icons.   The Muscovite period The Mongol (Tatar) invasions of the early 13th century decimated Kievan Rus. By the time Russian political and cultural life began to recover in the 14th century, a new centre had arisen: Muscovy (Moscow). Continuity with Kiev was provided by the Orthodox church, which had acted as a beacon of national life during the period of Tatar domination and continued to play the central role in Russian culture into the 17th century. As a result, Russian cultural development in the Muscovite period was quite different from that of western Europe, which at this time was experiencing the secularization of society and the rediscovery of the classical cultural heritage that characterized the Renaissance. At first the literary genres employed by Muscovite writers were the same as those that had dominated in Kiev. The most remarkable literary monuments of the Muscovite period, however, are unlike anything that came before. The correspondence between Tsar Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible) and Andrey Mikhaylovich, Prince Kurbsky during the 1560s and 70s is particularly noteworthy. Kurbsky, a former general in Ivans army, defected to Poland, whence he sent a letter critical of the tsars regime. Ivans diatribes in response are both wonderful expressions of outraged pride and literary tours de force that combine the highest style of Muscovite hagiographic writing with pithy and vulgar attacks on his enemy. Similarly vigorous in style is the first full-scale autobiography in Russian literature, Avvakum Petrovichs The Life of the Archpriest Avvakum, by Himself (c. 167275). Cathedral of St. Basil the BlessedCathedral of St. Basil the Blessed in Moscow, Russia.(more)As in the Kievan period, however, the most significant cultural achievements of Muscovy were in the visual arts and architecture rather than in literature. The Moscow school of icon painting produced great masters, among them Dionisy and Andrey Rublyov (whose Old Testament Trinity, now in Moscows Tretyakov Gallery, is among the most revered icons ever painted). Russian architects continued to design and build impressive churches, including the celebrated Cathedral of St. Basil the Blessed on Moscows Red Square. Built to commemorate the Russian capture of Kazar, the Tatar capital, St. Basils is a perfect example of the confluence of Byzantine and Asiatic cultural streams that characterizes Muscovite culture.   The emergence of modern Russian culture The gradual turn of Russia toward western Europe that began in the 17th century led to an almost total reorientation of Russian interests during the reign of Peter I (16821725). Although Peter (known as Peter the Great) was not particularly interested in cultural questions, the influx of Western ideas (which accompanied the technology Peter found so attractive) and the weakening of the Orthodox church led to a cultural renaissance during the reigns of his successors. In the late 1730s poets Mikhail Lomonosov and Vasily Trediakovsky carried out reforms as far-reaching as those of Peter. Adapting German syllabotonic versification to Russian, they developed the system of classical metres that prevails in Russian poetry to this day. In the 1740s, in imitation of French Neoclassicism, Aleksandr Sumarokov wrote the first Russian stage tragedies. In the course of the century, Russian writers assimilated all the European genres; although much of their work was derivative, the comedies of Denis Fonvizin and the powerful, solemn odes of Gavrila Derzhavin were original and have remained part of the active Russian cultural heritage. Prose fiction made its appearance at the end of the century in the works of the sentimentalist Nikolay Karamzin. By the beginning of the 19th century, after a 75-year European cultural apprenticeship, Russia had developed a flexible secular literary language, had a command of modern Western literary forms, and was ready to produce fully original cultural work.   "},{"CountryName":"Rwanda","CulturalInfo":" Health and welfare Health conditions in Rwanda, once poor, have improved in the 21st century owing to aggressive government policies and funding as well as funding from international donors. New health care facilities have been constructed throughout the country, and each town has trained health care workers, making it easier for Rwandans to access medical care. The government works in partnership with nongovernmental organizations and other entities to raise awareness of and treat different health issues. In addition, the governments health care insurance plan has made health care more affordable for many Rwandans. However, there is still a need for more doctors, especially those with areas of specialization and particularly in rural areas. Although the country still has a relatively high HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, innovative approaches to treatment resulted in the rates being halved within two years during the early 2000s. Malaria and tuberculosis are still serious health concerns, although in the first decade of the 21st century, the number of deaths from malaria dropped considerably, and the number of cases of tuberculosis declined. Nutritional deficiencies are a threat to the population, particularly to young children.   Education Six years of primary education is compulsory beginning at age seven. It is followed by six years of secondary education, consisting of two three-year cycles; the first cycle is also compulsory. Beginning in the 2000s, the government implemented, in stages, free primary and secondary education. In the early 1990s more than two-thirds of the primary-school-age population was enrolled, but the civil strife and the 1994 genocide severely disrupted the school system. Even prior to that, few Rwandans attended secondary schools, as those facilities had space for only 10 percent of the primary-school graduates. Progress has been made with rebuilding the education system, and more than four-fifths of the primary-school-age population was enrolled by the mid-2010s, with more than three-fifths completing their primary education. Enrollment in secondary schools has shown a marked increase since 2009. There are several private universities and colleges in Rwanda, as well as the University of Rwanda, which was formed by the 2013 merger of the seven existing public universities and colleges. Courses at the university level were previously taught in French, but English instruction was added in the mid-1990s to accommodate the postwar influx of Anglophone returnees from Uganda. Since 2008, English has been designated the language of instruction at all levels of education. About three-fifths of the population is literate, with men enjoying a slightly higher literacy rate than women.   Cultural life Holidays in Rwanda include those associated with the majority Christian population, such as Good Friday, Easter, and Christmas. The Feast of the Assumption is observed by the Roman Catholic community on August 15. Holidays celebrated by the Muslim community include d al-Fir, which marks the end of Ramadan, and d al-A, which marks the culmination of the hajj. Other holidays include Genocide Memorial Day, observed on April 7, and Independence Day, celebrated on July 1.  The arts Much of Rwandas traditional cultural heritage revolved around dances, praise songs, and dynastic poems designed to enhance the legitimacy of the Tutsi kingship. Since independence in 1962, another set of traditions has emerged, emphasizing a different cultural stream, identified with a Hutu heritage. Regional dances, including the celebrated hoe dance of the north, are given pride of place in the countrys cultural repertoire. Traditional crafts such as basketry, ceramics, and ironworks provide another element of continuity with the past.  "},{"CountryName":"Saudi-Arabia","CulturalInfo":" Housing of Saudi ArabiaNajrn, Saudi Arabia: mud dwellingsMud dwellings with crenellated rooftops typical of Najrn, Asir region, Saudi Arabia.(more)Because of the kingdoms geographic diversity, a wide variety of traditional housing types were embraced. These ranged from the conventional black tents of the Bedouin and mud-brick dwellings of agrarian villages to the lofty, ornate townhouses found in urban centres along the coast. Since the advent of oil wealth, the government has invested heavily in housing construction. It provides low-interest or interest-free loans to citizens wishing to purchase or build homes. Homes in newer areas are equipped with standard utilities (such as water, sewerage, and electricity) as well as many technical conveniences, such as Internet access and cable and satellite television. Towns in some rural areas, however, remain far removed from power and water networks.   Education Education is free at all levels and is given high priority by the government. The school system consists of elementary (grades 16), intermediate (79), and secondary (1012) schools. A significant portion of the curriculum at all levels is devoted to religious subjects, and, at the secondary level, students are able to follow either a religious or a technical track. Girls are able to attend school (all courses are segregated by gender), but fewer girls attend than boys. This disproportion is reflected in the rate of literacy, which exceeds 85 percent among males and is about 70 percent among females. Higher education has expanded at a remarkable pace. Institutions of higher education include the King Saud University (formerly the University of Riyadh, founded in 1957), the Islamic University (1961) at Medina, and the King Abdulaziz University (1967) in Jeddah. Other colleges and universities emphasize curricula in sciences and technology, military studies, religion, and medicine. Institutes devoted to Islamic studies in particular abound, and schools for religious pedagogy are located in several towns. Women typically receive college instruction in segregated institutions. Many foreign teachers are employed, especially in technical and medical schools. Large numbers of students travel abroad for university study. In an effort to improve Saudi Arabias status as a regional scientific hub and to help it compete in the sciences on an international level, in September 2009 the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology was opened near Jeddah. The campus hosted state-of-the-art laboratories, virtual reality facilities, and one of the worlds most powerful supercomputers. The coed universitymany of whose students were drawn from abroadstrove to provide a comparatively liberal environment relative to the rest of Saudi society: women were permitted to drive on campus, which was not allowed on public roads until 2018, and were free to veil or unveil at their discretion.

This ban on cinema was reversed in 2018, however, as part of a set of economic and social reforms implemented by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

"},{"CountryName":"Senegal","CulturalInfo":"Housing of SenegalIn rural areas dwellings are usually well constructed and roofed with straw, with walls made of either earth or straw. In more-prosperous villages roofs may be made of corrugated iron; the walls may be made of cement brick. Houses in towns are constructed of cement and have roofs either of tile or of corrugated iron; typically, many families are crowded together in these dwellings. Migration from the countryside has expanded the population of urban areas and resulted in the proliferation of shantytowns. Wolof villages, which are small, contain about a hundred households. Because the topography provides no natural obstacles, each village may easily be moved from place to place. The houses are built of locally obtained materials. Harvests are kept in straw granaries, located far from the housing compounds for fear of fire. In the area around the Saloum River, each Wolof village is surrounded by three concentric zones of vegetation. The first of thesethe inner zoneconsists of fields and vegetable gardens. The second circle consists of land that has been exhausted, except for peanut cultivation. The third, the farthest from the village, is where cereal crops are cultivated. The typical Malinke village has between 200 and 300 inhabitants living in enclosed compounds and crowded together in geometrically aligned rectangular huts. Agriculture and stock raising are the principal economic activities. Each village is usually headed by a chief or a Muslim marabout, who, like most traditional leaders, is conservative in outlook. Unlike Wolof and Malinke villages, Serer family compounds are more dispersed, and each one is autonomous. On the islands at the mouth of the Saloum River, each Nyiominka Serer compound contains solidly built houses and a granary. Diola villages contain 5,000 or more people. Like those of the Serer, the compounds are not grouped in any distinguishable hierarchy. These villages are characteristically built on the edge of a plateau or on ground overlooking the rice fields, which are associated with Diola life. Their houses are the best-built and most-permanent village dwellings in Senegal. On occasion they constitute veritable fortifications, as in Thionck-Essil and Oussouye. The villages near Essil also can be quite sophisticated, with many of them equipped with rainwater-catchment systems. Diola and Serer villages have no chiefs with authority or prestige comparable to those of Wolof or Malinke villages. Education Western education has existed in Senegal since the 19th century; its first goal was to train the Senegalese in French culture and to help with colonial administration. Since independence Senegal has made particular efforts to increase school enrollment in rural areas, although with limited success; the literacy rate remains one of the lowest in the world. Among the secondary schools, the Faidherbe Lyce at Saint-Louis and the Van Vollenhoven Lyce at Dakar are the oldest and most renowned. Technical education is expanding and is provided by institutions in Dakar, Saint-Louis, Diourbel, Kaolack, and Louga. Higher education developed from the School of Medicine of Dakar (1918). It achieved full status as a university in the French system in 1957 and became known as the University of Dakar. The name was changed in 1987 to University Cheikh Anta Diop to honour a Senegalese scholar and politician. Following disturbances in 1968, Senegal concluded an agreement with France that emphasized a more African-based curriculum. The College of Sciences and Veterinary Medicine for French-speaking Africa is also located in Dakar, and a polytechnic college opened at This in 1973. The University of Saint-Louis, founded in 1990, was renamed University Gaston-Berger in 1996 for a Senegalese philosopher who was born in Saint-Louis. Approximately one-fifth of the students attending these schools are foreign, mostly from the French-speaking countries of Guinea, Mali, and Burkina Faso.Cultural life Daily life and social customs Collectivism is central to traditional Senegalese culture, which remains very much alive. Although written forms of languages spoken in Senegal have existed for some time, the countrys cultural heritage is preserved through oral tradition, mainly by the oldest men of the community, who are at the summit of Senegals hierarchical society. Rites and initiations are actively practiced in rural areasfor example, by the Basari of Kdougou. Among Muslims, youths must be circumcised before being accorded the responsibilities of manhood. Even though the constitution prohibits discrimination by sex, traditional religious beliefs in many parts of the country prohibit women from inheriting land, and society generally recognizes men as the heads of the households. A wide variety of foods are available in Senegal. Millet, couscous, and rice form the basis of many meals; peanuts and fresh seafood are common sources of protein; and chiles and palm oil are used for flavouring. Common dishes include thiboudienne, rice served with a fish and vegetable sauce; yassa au poulet or yassa au poisson, grilled chicken or fish in an onion and lemon sauce; and maf, a peanut-based stew. Meals are generally eaten communally from a single serving dish, as they are in many parts of West Africa, and a code of conduct called fayda ensures proper sharing. Senegalese beer is produced primarily by breweries in Dakar. Independence Day is celebrated on April 4th. The country also celebrates various Christian and Islamic holidays. "},{"CountryName":"Serbia","CulturalInfo":"Health and welfareInterwar Yugoslavia was noted for the endemic presence of malaria, typhus, typhoid, syphilis, dysentery, and trachoma. By the 1980s, however, these scourges had been reduced to individual cases. Still, Serbia suffers from significant health problems. Even before the civil unrest of the 1990s, infant mortality was fairly high, especially in Kosovo. Only in the Vojvodina region did health standards approach those of central and western Europe. Despite marked improvements in medical services, the countrys population suffers from crowded housing conditions, poor nutrition, and lack of sanitary services.Pregnant women, infants, and children up to age 15 receive complete health care, as do students up to age 26. All citizens also are entitled to treatment for infectious diseases and mental illness. Still, about one-fifth of the population remain outside the health care system.Great emphasis is placed on training doctors. Before World War II one doctor served every 12,000 inhabitants in Yugoslavia. By the 1990s the number of doctors had increased dramatically throughout the country, though Kosovo was the most poorly served region, with about half as many doctors per inhabitant as the countrys other regions.The communist regime of Yugoslavia established a comprehensive social welfare system that continues to provide a wide range of services in Serbia. All economically active persons are entitled to retirement and disability pensions; unemployment compensation and family allowances also are provided. These activities are the responsibility of commune governments, and significant variations exist between the administrative units.HousingHousing is a perennial problem, particularly for young people in urban areas. Most city dwellers live in small apartments in high-rise buildings. Although communes bear responsibility for housing construction, much of the new housing stock has been built by enterprises. Most villagers build and own their homes.The civil strife in the 1990s left some two-thirds of the population impoverished and hundreds of thousands homeless. Assistance from the West only partially resolved the problem of housing, feeding, clothing, and providing medical care for a significant proportion of the population.EducationEight years of primary education are compulsory in Serbia, beginning at age seven. Four years of secondary education also are available, divided between two types of schools: general secondary schools, which prepare students for universities, and vocational schools, which offer training that usually leads to admission to two-year technical colleges. There are several universities; the largest is the University of Belgrade, founded in 1863.The communist regime of Yugoslavia made great strides toward eliminating illiteracy. In 1921 about two-thirds of Serbs and Montenegrins and nine-tenths of the countrys Albanians could not read or write. By the 1950s less than half the total population was literate. Less than one-tenth now remains illiterate, ranging lower in the Vojvodina.Cultural lifeTraditional Serbian society has a strong peasant patriarchal tradition that evolved under Ottoman domination and is still reflected in family and government structures. A distinctive feature is the zadruga, a corporate family group of 100 or more individuals that originally worked the land under the direction of family elders. The zadruga functioned as a rural tradition well into the communist era. The advent of modern public services, however, took a toll on this system. Even as elders lived increasingly longer, younger adults educated in an expanding school system chafed at patriarchal authority. By the 1970s the zadruga system had evolved into a less-onerous system of cooperative extended family groups. Nevertheless, family loyalties continue to play a major role in Serbia, where nepotism in the workplace is a recurring phenomenon.Daily life and social customsThe cities of Belgrade and Novi Sad offer a cosmopolitan milieu, and the people there frequent cafs and pubs, take their meals late (in the southern European tradition), and have access to a range of entertainment, from sporting events to poetry readings and gallery openings.As is true of rural societies elsewhere, the Serbian countryside is a great repository of old customs, traditions, folklore, and belief. Anthropologists still travel there to gather stories of vampires and ghosts, while until the 1960s scholars collected long epic poems from the guslars, or folksingers, who preserved them through memorization. Many rural women still create elaborate traditional costumes that are worn during holidays and family celebrations.In addition to Orthodox Christian holidays, Serbs celebrate secular holidays such as Labour Day (May 1) and Constitution Day (February 15). Belgrade hosts a range of cultural festivals, and Novi Sad is the site of a heavily attended agricultural fair held each May.Even the most urbane Serbs enjoy traditional cuisine, and the Skadarlija district in the heart of Belgrade abounds in restaurants serving national dishes as well as foods from all over the world. Serbian cuisine reflects its Byzantine and Ottoman heritage and resembles that of Greece and Turkey in many respects. The national dish is evapii, consisting of small rolled patties of mixed ground meats that are heavily seasoned and grilled. Other popular dishes include sarma (stuffed cabbage), podvarak (roast meat with sauerkraut), and moussaka (a casserole of minced meat, eggs, and potatoes). Food is usually accompanied by domestically produced wines and slivovitz (plum brandy)."},{"CountryName":"Seychelles","CulturalInfo":"Markers not found in Cultural life section"},{"CountryName":"Sierra-Leone","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life\nSocial customs\nThe Poro society for men and the Sande society for girls play an educational role in village culture; initiation into these societies is a rite of passage. Holidays observed in the country include the Christian celebrations of Christmas and Easter and the Muslim festivals of d al-Fir (which marks the end of Ramadan), d al-A (which marks the culmination of the hajj), and the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad (see mawlid). Independence Day is celebrated on April 27, the anniversary of Sierra Leones becoming an independent state within the Commonwealth.\nThe arts\nThe most outstanding feature of the countrys cultural life is its dancing. The internationally known Sierra Leone National Dance Troupe first won widespread acclaim at the 196465 New York Worlds Fair and continues to perform in the 21st century. The different communities of the country have their own styles of costume and dance. In addition, certain closed societies, such as the Wunde, the Sande (Bundu), and the Gola, have characteristic ceremonial dances. A wide range of agility, gracefulness, and rhythm is displayed; in addition, there are elements of symbolism in most of the dances. Drums, wooden xylophones (called balaphones), and various stringed instruments provide the musical background.\nThe carving of various wooden masks in human and animal figures for the dances is especially advanced in the southern region. The Sande mask worn on the head of the chief dancer during the ceremony that welcomes the reappearance of female initiates from their period of seclusion is perhaps the best-known carved figure in Sierra Leonean art. It is a black symmetrically stylized head of an African woman with an elaborately plaited pyramidal coiffure adorned with various figures and with a facial expression of grave dignity and beauty. The iconography is of great significance and meaning.\nIvory figures are characteristic of the Sherbro, Bullom, and Temne peoples of the coastal and northern regions. Fine examples of these figures, which were bought or commissioned by Portuguese traders during the 16th century, are still extant. There are also steatite human figures, sometimes distorted, called nomolior, in wooden form, pomtan (singular, pombo)that certainly date earlier than the 16th century and were used probably for ancestor worship or fertility rites. At present they are used for ceremonies to ensure abundance of crops. Containers or rattles are carved from gourds and are decorated with intricate geometric patterns that are burned into them.\nThe weaving of cloth, typically blue, brown, white, or a combination of these colours, is carried out in the southern and eastern regions by the Mende and the Kono. Thread spun from the cotton bush Gossypium is used in weaving. This handwoven cloth is an important item of barter and wealth and is used in many ceremonies and rituals. The cloth is made into coats for men or is worn as a wraparound lower-body garment by women and is also used as a bedspread. In the north, among the Temne, imported cotton or satin is tie-dyed in beautiful patterns with indigo, the red juice of the kola nut, or imported dyes. In the west, baskets are made with dyed raffia, and patterned slippers are fashioned from dyed wool.\nThere is an active school of modern artists who were trained in Europe and the United States and whose paintings have been exhibited locally and abroad. Olayinka Burney Nicol, Hassan Bangura, John Vandi, Koso Thomas, and Gladys Metzger are among the best-known artists of Sierra Leone. There are also local artisans who have not been formally trained but who produce a diverse array of art.\nThere has been a literary tradition in Freetown since the 19th century. One of the most prolific writers was James Africanus Beale Horton, who wrote books and pamphlets on politics, science, and medicine while serving as a medical officer in the British army between 1857 and 1871. A.B.C. Sibthorpe, lauded as the first Sierra Leonean historian of Sierra Leone, wrote one of the earliest accounts of his countrys history in 1868. There are also 19th-century works on exploration by Sierra Leoneans Samuel Adjai Crowther, an Anglican bishop, and John Christopher Taylor, another clergyman.\nSierra Leone is represented in most anthologies of African- and English-language poetry and short stories. In addition, the novels and short stories of Sarif Easmon, William Conton, and Eldred Jones give a vivid picture of modern life in the country. One of the 20th centurys most prominent writers was Thomas Decker, who published several works in Krio and translated English-language works, including Shakespeare, into Krio. More-recent works by Syl Cheney Coker and Lemuel Johnson have contributed to Sierra Leones literary tradition. Sierra Leone also has representation in the world of theatre with playwrights Dele Charley and Yulisa Amadu (Pat) Maddy.\nCultural institutions\nThe Sierra Leone National Museum in Freetown contains historical, ethnographic, and archaeological collections. Other museums include the Sierra Leone National Railway Museum, also in Freetown. Bunce Island, a national historic site, was once home to a British slave castle that operated from the 1670s until 1808; tours of the island are conducted among the ruins of the old dormitories, factory house, prison, and watchtowers. Fourah Bay College and Njala University College both have libraries; the former houses the public archives.\n"},{"CountryName":"Singapore","CulturalInfo":"Markers not found in Cultural life section"},{"CountryName":"Slovakia","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life  Cultural milieu The antecedents of a distinct Slovak culture date from the Christian mission sent to Moravia in 863 ce by the Byzantine emperor Michael III at the request of the Moravian prince Rostislav; the Moravian state then encompassed at least part of the territory of present-day Slovakia. Byzantine influence was short-lived, however, and did not survive the competition with Latinized western Christianity. Slavic liturgy disappeared from the region after the invasions by nomadic Magyar (Hungarian) tribes toward the end of the 9th century. These Magyar invasions also succeeded in separating the West Slavic ancestors of todays Slovaks, living north of the Danube River, from the South Slavs. Thereafter, until the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the history of the Slovaks was closely connected with that of Hungary. Slovak culture, particularly the Slovak language, survived despite Hungarian hegemony and the widespread use of Czech, Latin, and German. In the 15th century, Hussites from Bohemia brought the Czech language and culture to Slovakia, and Slovak Lutherans used Czech as both their liturgical and literary language, but they remained a distinct minority. Roman Catholicism continued as the majority religion, and Latin was used not only for liturgical purposes but also as the main administrative language until almost the mid-19th century, when it was replaced by Hungarian. German was widely used by the aristocracy and the urban middle class, owing to the influence of the Habsburg monarchy. The first Slovak intellectuals to be concerned with the preservation of the Slovak language and culture emerged during the Enlightenment and the French revolutionary wars. Although primarily educated in Hungarian, the Slovak intelligentsiawhether priests, lawyers, or doctorscommunicated with Slovak peasants and servants in their language and helped to accelerate the spread of modern Slovak literacy. Hungarian nationalists reacted by enforcing Magyarization at every level of education beyond primary school; contemporary experts predicted the extinction of the Slovak nation within a generation. Nevertheless, the number of Slovaks attending secondary schools and colleges in Hungary continued to increase, and selective censorship could not stop the spread of Slovak newspapers and books. With the creation of Slovakia within the new country of Czechoslovakia, the durability of the Slovak language and culture was confirmed. Shortly after Slovakias independence, Slovak became enshrined as the countrys official language.   Daily life and social customs The rich folklore and customs of many Slovak regions have survived into modern times. They are on full display in the Catholic parishes, especially during the two main Christian holidays. A genuine Roman Catholic Christmas in Slovakia includes the three days of Christmas (December 2426) and is carried over to Three Kings Day (January 6). Traditional Christmas carols are typically a part of the festivities. In some regions Easter, particularly Good Friday, is the biggest religious holiday of the year. Apart from religious celebrations, numerous folk music festivals take place in Slovakia. These may feature both Slovak and Roma performers. Slovak food and drink have been influenced by the surrounding, mostly Hungarian and German, cuisine. Traditional Slovak food consists of a wide range of soups, gruels, boiled and stewed vegetables, roasted and smoked meats, and dairy products, especially sheeps milk cheese (bryndza). Bryndzov haluky, small potato dumplings mixed with bryndza, is a Slovak specialty. Viticulture was brought to Slovakia by the ancient Romans as they advanced along the Danube 2,000 years ago, and vineyards still are found along the Danube and Vh rivers. In addition to wine, brandy is a popular drink in Slovakia. Typical Slovak brandies include the plum-based slivovica and the juniper-based borovika.   The arts  Literature and drama Although Slovak dialects had been distinct from Czech since the Middle Ages, a Slovak literary language did not develop until the late 18th century. The Catholic priest Jn Holl (17851849) was the first Slovak writer to use the Slovak language successfully in his poetry. The language had been recently codified by another priest, Anton Bernolk, who had based his codification on the Western Slovak dialect. Yet Bernolks Slovak failed to catch on, owing to a lack of followers and strong opposition by educated Slovak Lutherans, who used Czech as their literary language. Even Jn Kollrs Slvy dcera (1824; The Daughter of Slva), considered a principal work of Slovak literature and among the impulses behind Pan-Slavism, was written in Czech. It was up to a younger group of Slovak Lutheran writers, headed by Ludovt tr, to abandon Czech in favour of Slovak. This time the codification was based on the Central Slovak dialect. Later poets, using a refined form of literary Slovak, continued to produce nationalistic and Romantic works, such as Marna (1846), by Andrej Sldkovi (Andrej Braxatoris), and the ballads of Janko Krl, whose exploits in the Revolutions of 1848 made him a legend. In the first half of the 20th century, poetry, particularly lyric poetry, continued to be the chief strength of Slovak literature. Notable poets included Hviezdoslav (Pavol Orszgh), Svetozr Hurban Vajansk, Ivan Krasko (Jn Botto), Martin Rzus, Janko Jesensk, and Emil Boleslav Luk. However, important Slovak novelistssuch as Timrava (Boena Slankova), Milo Urban, and Margita Figulialso emerged. With the foundation of Czechoslovakia and the further expansion of Slovak education, Slovak writings multiplied. The difficulties of World War II and its aftermath of communist rule found vivid, personal expression in the work of Ladislav Mako, Alfonz Bednr, and Dominik Tatarka. Mako was among the first eastern European writers to criticize Stalinism, in his popular novel The Taste of Power (1967), while Tatarka attacked the Gustav Husk regimes process of normalization in Czechoslovakia after 1969 in Sm proti noci (1984; Alone Against the Night). In the years leading up to the Velvet Revolution of 1989, such novelists as Ladislav Ballek, Vincent ikula, and Jn Johanides asserted a distinct Slovak voice. During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, a new generation of writersincluding Duan Mitana, Pavel Vilikovsk, and Martin imekadistinguished themselves. Slovak drama developed at about the same time as Slovak literature; Juraj Palkovis play Dva buchy a tri uchy (1800; Two Bumps and Three Rubs) is considered the first example. Jn Chalupka produced a lively satire, Kocrkovo, in 1830, while Jn Palrik wrote popular comedies, including Inkognito (1857; Incognito) and Zmierenie (1862; The Reconciliation). The best-known Slovak playwright of the 20th century was Peter Karva, author of The Diplomats, The Midnight Mass, and Antigone and the Others, among many other plays. (See also Slovak literature.) Robert Auty Z.A.B. Zeman Milan Hauner  "},{"CountryName":"Slovenia","CulturalInfo":"Government and society\nConstitutional framework\nSlovenias constitution, which was adopted in 1991, established a parliamentary form of government. A president, whose role is largely ceremonial, serves as head of state; presidents are popularly elected for a five-year term and can serve two consecutive terms. The head of government is the prime minister, who is normally the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly (lower house of the parliament), with which most legislative authority rests. Of its 90 members, 88 are elected by proportional representation to four-year terms, with the remaining two seats reserved for one representative each from the Italian- and Hungarian-speaking communities. The nonpartisan National Council, which represents economic and local interests, principally performs an advisory role, but it has the authority to propose new laws, to request the Constitutional Court to review legislative acts, and to initiate national referenda.\nLocal government\nThe obina (municipality) is Slovenias local administrative unit. The country is divided into hundreds of municipalities, about a dozen of which have the status of urban municipality. A popularly elected mayor, municipal council, and supervisory committee govern each municipality. Local government in Slovenia is chiefly responsible for municipal services, primary education, and the administration of social and cultural programs.\nJustice\nSlovenias judiciary consists of a Supreme Court and a system of lower courts, the district and regional courts, which hear both civil and criminal cases. The High Labour and Social Court deals with individual and collective labour issues and social disputes. The Constitutional Court is the highest body of judicial authority and upholds the constitutionality and legality of the legislative acts.\nJudges are elected by the National Assembly after nomination by the 11-member Judicial Council. Every six years the National Assembly also elects an ombudsman, who is charged with protecting the publics human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Constitutional Court is composed of nine judges who are elected for a term of nine years.\nPolitical process\nAll Slovene citizens age 18 and older are eligible to vote. The first free and democratic elections in Slovenia were held in April 1990. Until that time the only authorized political party was the Communist Party. Following the introduction of a multiparty system, the centre-left Liberal Democratic Party dominated the parliament at the head of various coalitions until 2004, when the centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party gained a majority in the 2004 elections and formed a coalition with the New SloveniaChristian Peoples Party, the Slovenian Democratic Party of Pensioners, and the Slovenian Peoples Party. In the 2008 parliamentary elections the centre-left Social Democrats narrowly edged out the Slovenian Democratic Party.\nSecurity\nThe Slovenian Armed Forces (Slovenska Vojska; SV) consist of an army, a navy, and an air force. Slovenes become eligible to serve in the countrys voluntary military forces at age 17. Conscription was abolished in 2003, the year before Slovenia became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Slovenias specialized capabilities within NATO include mountain warfare, demining, policing, special operations, and field medicine. Slovenian troops have taken part in many United Nations peacekeeping missions, including those in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s and in Afghanistan and the Middle East in the early 2000s.\nHealth and welfare\nThe state provides most medical services, and Slovenias public health system is one of the best developed in central and eastern Europe, though there is a lack of physicians in some remote areas of the country and in certain specialized fields of medicine. Social services provided by the government include unemployment, disability, and pension insurance, as well as family and dependant allowances. Both the pension system and social service programs have faced problems owing to the countrys aging population and shrinking workforce. In 2000 Slovenias pension system was reformed to raise the retirement age and to introduce special circumstances that would allow some people to qualify for an earlier retirement. Pensioners accounted for about one-fourth of the population in the middle of the first decade of the 21st century.\nThe Slovene state started several social housing programs in 1996. By the early 2000s, several thousand one- and two-bedroom apartments had been built for low-income families. In general, real-estate prices in Slovenia are comparable to those in most European countries. Property is generally more expensive in the capital and along the Adriatic coast.\nEducation\nVirtually all Slovenes age 15 and older are literate. Primary schooling is compulsory and free for all children between ages 6 and 15. Secondary schools are either vocational or academic. A diploma from a secondary school is the main requirement for admission to one of Slovenias three chief universitiesthose of Ljubljana, Maribor, and Koper (University of Primorska). The University of Ljubljana, founded in 1595 and reopened in 1919, has divisions that include the natural sciences, the social sciences, the humanities and arts, education, theology, law, medicine, and engineering. The University of Maribor, founded in 1975, is vocationally oriented. There are also several independent technical and vocational schools. In the ethnically mixed regions of Istria and Prekmurje, classes are taught in Italian and Hungarian along with Slovene.\nThe Slovene government finances research institutes, especially in the natural sciences and technology. A Slovene scholarly tradition dates back to the 17th-century, when the Carniolan polymath Johann Weichard Freiherr von Valvasor provided some of the first written and pictorial descriptions of the Slovene landscape, in his encyclopaedic volumes Die Ehre des Herzogtums Krain (1689; Glory of the Duchy of Carniola). The premier centres of research include the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (1938) and the Joef Stefan Institute (1949), the latter for scientific research.\nCultural life\nSlovenes enjoy a wide-ranging cultural life, dominated by literature, art, and music. Little of the Slovene culture is known outside the country, however, for few Slovene artists have attained international recognition. Slovenes are proud of their countrys artistic accomplishments. Many European performers and tourists go to Maribor and Ljubljana to participate in and attend many musical galas.\nDaily life and social customs\nEaster and Christmas are major holidays in Slovenia. Easter is a weeklong observance and involves feasting, processions, and caroling. Kurentovanje, a pre-Lenten festival marking the beginning of spring and grounded in fertility rites, is celebrated in most towns. Its name is derived from the Kurent, a mythical figure who was believed to have the power to chase away winter and usher in spring. Groups of people dressed as Kurents (Kurenti) wear sheepskin, don masks and fur caps, and travel through town chasing away winter and evil spirits.\nSummer in general is a festive time in Slovenia; the Ljubljana Summer Festival in July and August draws large crowds to its music, theatre, and dance performances, and the Kravji Bal (Cows Ball) in September celebrates the return of the bovines to the valleys. Folkloric festivals are held in the towns of Kamnik and kofja Loka.\nTraditional Slovene dishes include different type of sausages, among them are krvavice (blood sausages). Other mainstays are prut (cured ham), cheeses, and desserts such as the gibanica, a layered pastry made with various fillings. Mushroom dishes of all kinds are popular.\n"},{"CountryName":"Solomon-Islands","CulturalInfo":"Malaita, Solomon IslandsReef island off Malaita, Solomon Islands.(more)Solomon Islands,  country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.

Polynesians, who form a small minority, live mainly on outlying atolls, principally Ontong Java Atoll, Bellona, Rennell Island, the Reef Islands, the Stewart Islands (Sikaiana), Tikopia, and Anuta. There are also small numbers of Chinese and Europeans and of Gilbertese from Micronesia who were resettled on Ghizo and Vaghena islands between 1955 and 1971 by British administrators seeking to alleviate overpopulation in the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati). Almost all Solomon Islanders are Christian; most are Protestant (mainly Church of Melanesia [Anglican]), with smaller numbers of Roman Catholics and members of other denominations. A small minority practices traditional beliefs. More than 60 languages and dialects are spoken. English is the official language, but Pijin, an English-based Melanesian pidgin, is the language that is most widely used and understood.   Economy Civil unrest in the late 1990s and early 21st century, including a coup in 2000, led to the near collapse of the countrys economy. Damage to infrastructure on Guadalcanal resulted, disrupting transportation, commerce, and agriculture, and many enterprises were forced out of business. The 2007 earthquakes and tsunami caused further economic setbacks. In the early 21st century the service sector employed the majority of the active workforce and contributed almost half of the countrys gross domestic product. Tourism has been developed but is not a major source of income. Solomon Islands main resources, fish and timber, have been exploited excessively, which has resulted in their depletion. Its other export products are derived from plantation crops: palm oil, copra, and cacao (the source of cocoa). China and Australia are the major recipients. The chief imports are machinery, fuels, manufactured goods, and food, and Australia, Singapore, and China are the main suppliers. The islands have significant reserves of bauxite (on Rennell Island) and phosphates (on Bellona), and some gold has been extracted on Guadalcanal. Manufacturing primarily involves the processing of coconut and other vegetable oils and of cocoa. Traditional handicrafts, including woodwork, shell inlay, mats, baskets, and shell jewelry, are made both for the tourist market and for export. The Solomon Islands dollar is the official currency; indigenous currencies such as shell money (from Malaita) and red-feather money (from Santa Cruz) are also made for use in customary transactions. The principal airport is Honiara International Airport, although there are several airfields throughout the islands that may also serve as international points of entry. The government-owned Solomon Airlines provides domestic and regional air service. Ports handling overseas cargoes include Honiara, Tulagi (the former capital), and Gizo Harbour. Aola Bay, Viru Harbour, and Graciosa Bay are used mainly for log exports. Interisland shipping is operated both privately and by the government.   Government and society Solomon Islands is a constitutional monarchy, with the British monarch, represented by a governor-general, serving as the formal head of state. Still, the country, a member of the Commonwealth, is independent, and the governor-general is appointed on the advice of the unicameral National Parliament. The governor-general, who serves a term of up to five years, must be a citizen of Solomon Islands. Members of the Parliament are elected by universal adult suffrage and serve for four years (unless Parliament is dissolved sooner). Executive power is exercised by a prime minister (elected by and from Parliament) and a cabinet appointed by the governor-general from among the members of Parliament on the recommendation of the prime minister. Although political parties exist in name, their organization and discipline tend to be loose. The prime minister rarely commands a clear majority in Parliament, and so governments are usually formed of a coalition of parties or factions. Local government councils control matters regarding transportation, economic development, health, and education. Education is not compulsory. Schools are run both by the national and provincial governments and by various churches. Many secondary schools provide practical training in fields such as agriculture and development studies. There are several teacher-training schools and a technical institute, as well as a campus of the University of the South Pacific in Honiara. Some students attend universities overseas, especially in Fiji and Papua New Guinea. There is a hospital at Honiara.\n   Cultural life traditionally dressed dancers, Solomon IslandsTraditionally dressed dancers in Honiara, Solomon Islands.(more)Much of traditional culture endures.

Only about 1,800 miles (2,900 km) of paved roads are passable year-round, and in the rainy seasons most rural settlements are not accessible by motor vehicle. Buses, trucks, and minibuses are the main means of transport for the population. In rural areas camels, cattle, and donkeys are still used for personal transportation and as pack animals. The state-owned Somali Airlines ceased operations in 1991 after the government collapse. Mogadishu, Berbera, and Kismaayo all have airports with long runways.

Government and society  Constitutional framework Under the 1979 constitution, amended in 1990, the president and his supporters held the important positions of power, and a Peoples Assembly had no real power. The legal system was based largely on Islamic law; an independent judiciary did not exist; and human rights were frequently violated. Only one legal political party, the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party, and various socialist-style mass organizations existed. Following the collapse of the central government in 1991, the constitution was ignored. Various clan-based political coalitions and alliances attempted to establish control throughout the country. In May 1991 one such alliance declared the formation of the independent Republic of Somaliland in the north, and in July 1998 another declared the formation of the autonomous region of Puntland in the northeast. Each formed its own government, although neither is recognized by the international community. Meanwhile, the fragmented, conflict-riven south lay largely in the hands of various clan-based militia groups at war with each other, despite several attempts to end the conflict and form a new government. The last transitional government was the result of the Transitional Federal Charter, promulgated in 2004. It provided for a Transitional Federal Parliament and a Transitional Federal Government, which consisted of a president, a prime minister, and a cabinet called the Council of Ministers. The charter was amended in 2009 to extend the transitional governments original five-year mandate for another two years and again in 2011 to extend it for one more year. On August 20, 2012, the day that the transitional administration was due to expire, the lower house of a new federal parliament was sworn in; the next month, that body elected a new president for the country.   Health and welfare Many years of conflict, severe drought, and famine have left Somalia in a state of crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Somalis have been displaced by warfare. Chronic food shortages have led to high rates of malnutrition in many parts of the country. Much of Somalia is without adequate water supplies or sanitation. Cholera, measles, tuberculosis, and malaria are widespread. The absence of health or welfare infrastructure in the countrylargely destroyed after years of conflicthas left international relief organizations struggling to provide essential services normally offered by the government. Their efforts are hindered by continuing violence, and most Somalis have little or no access to health care. Conditions in the Republic of Somaliland and in Puntland are somewhat better than in the rest of the country but still fall short of ideal. Because of the overall level of stability enjoyed by the two self-governing regions, they have been able to rebuild much of their health care infrastructure.   Housing There are two main types of traditional houses: the typically African round house (mundul), mainly found in the interior, and the Arab-influenced rectangular house (cariish) with a corrugated-steel roof, prevailing in the coastal regions and northern Somalia. The strong influence from Arabia, Persia, and India has shaped the face of the old coastal town centres, and Italian colonial architecture is visible in Mogadishu. Solid constructions of traditional coral limestone and modern concrete brick clearly distinguish the large coastal settlements from the district and provincial capitals of the interior, where traditional wooden houses with thatched or corrugated-iron roofs predominate. Pastoral nomads still live in transportable round huts called aqal. During the dry seasons, the high mobility of these livestock keepers leads to their temporary concentration in the river valleys of southern Somalia and around important water points all over the country.   Education Prior to the countrys civil war and the resulting anarchy, the state educational system was somewhat successful despite considerable shortcomings. Enrollment in primary and secondary schools had multiplied, and the proportion of girls attending school also had risenat least in towns. However, a lack of buildings, furniture, equipment, teaching materials, and teachers, together with the frequent unwillingness of rural people to allow children to attend school instead of working, all prevented a rapid improvement of schooling in rural areas. After the government was overthrown in 1991, Somalias state education system was in shambles. Private schools have managed to function since then, as have schools in the Republic of Somaliland and Puntland. Some Islamic schools are also operational, but traditionally these Qurnic schools are responsible for the religious education of children according to Islamic law and do not provide secular education. The main higher education institution had been Somali National University (1969) in Mogadishu, but the campus was destroyed during the civil war. The private Mogadishu University was established in 1997. There are also agricultural secondary schools, a vocational training centre, a teacher-training centre, and an agricultural college in Mogadishu, as well as a technical college in Burgo. Most of these institutions were unable to consistently maintain operations because of warfare. Amoud University (1997) in Borama and the University of Hargeisa (2000) are private universities in the Republic of Somaliland. About one-fifth of Somalis aged 15 and older are literate.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Somalia has a rich oral tradition: in effect, every Somali is a walking repository of the countrys stories, myths, traditions, and genealogies. Although Islam is the predominant religion, indigenous beliefs remain strong and are often syncretized with those of the Qurn to provide a belief system unique to the country. Somali mythology dates to pre-Islamic times and includes belief in jinn, supernatural spirits, and ghouls (ghls), treacherous shape-changing spirits, who are said to inhabit significant features of the landscape, including wells, crossroads, and burial grounds. Also extremely important is astrology, which is thought to provide divinations of the days ahead; some Somalis believe that the appearance of certain stars, constellations, and eclipses can presage everything from the coming of rain to a massacre.  "},{"CountryName":"South-Africa","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Blending Western technology with indigenous technology, Western traditions with African and Asian traditions, South Africa is a study in contrasts. It also provides lessons in how cultures can sometimes blend, sometimes collide; for example, within a short distance of one another can be found the villas of South Africas white elite and the tar-paper shacks of Black day labourers, office buildings with the most sophisticated electronic wiring and one-room houses that lack electricity. A great gulf still exists between the white minority and the Black majority in matters of education and economic opportunity. Yet, South Africa is making steady progress in erasing some of these historic disparities and their consequences. Daily life is better for most of its people, and culture and the arts, which sometimes were forced into exile, are flourishing in the free climate of the postapartheid era. Daily life and social customs As they are everywhere in the world, patterns of daily life in South Africa are conditioned by social class, ethnicity, religion, and residence: the life of a Black diamond miner in Limpopo province is much different from that of an Indian shopkeeper in Durban, an Afrikaner office worker in Johannesburg, or a teacher of English extraction in Cape Town. As the government struggles to expand the economy in order to provide equally for all citizens, great disparities continue to exist. Yet, all these people are likely to enjoy much the same pleasures: the company of family and friends, films from the studios of Johannesburg and Hollywood alike, music and dance, and visits to South Africas magnificent national parks and scenic landscapes. bobotieBobotie, a type of meat pie eaten in South Africa.(more)The great mixture of cultures makes for a wide variety of food choices in the country, from the traditional food of various cultures to the cosmopolitan cuisine that is available in many large cities throughout the world. African food is centred around vegetables, with maize (corn) as an important staple, often in the form of a porridge known as mealie pap. A dish made from broken dried corn kernels, sugar beans, butter, onions, potatoes, chiles, and lemon is called umngqusho. It is still possible to visit a shebeen, an African tavern where beer is home-brewed. Dutch and English settlers introduced sausages and bobotie, a meat pie made with minced meat that has been cooked with brown sugar, apricots and raisins, milk-soaked mashed bread, and curry flavouring. The Portuguese introduced various fish dishes to the country. The Indian influence added spices and even samosas, savoury pastries popular as a snack. All South Africans enjoy the braai, a South African barbeque. Beef, chicken, lamb, pork, ostrich, and other game meat are savoured, although meat consumption is limited in many places because of its expense. Among its holidays, South Africa celebrates Human Rights Day on March 21, Freedom Day on April 27 (to celebrate the first majority elections in 1994), National Womens Day on August 9, Heritage Day on September 24, and Day of Reconciliation on December 16. The arts A century and a half of white domination in most of the country (more than three centuries in the Western Cape) and the great extent of its ties to the global market economy have profoundly transformed Black culture in South Africa. The strongest links to traditional societies have been through the many languages embodying the countrys cultural diversity, whose nuances of idiom and sensibility carry over into the arts. Traditional art forms such as dancing and textile weaving are used as vehicles of ethnic identity and are carefully preserved, while modern art forms from painting to literature have flourished in the years since the end of apartheid. Still, much of this has taken place through private initiatives because major institutional support for culture has been largely abandoned, especially for cultural projects perceived as elitist or European in orientation; the closing of the National Symphony Orchestra in 2000 is one such example. Music Many popular South African arts represent a fusion of cultural influences, such as township jazz and pop music, religious choral music, and so-called traditional dances performed competitively by mine workers in decidedly untraditional settings. Others are innovations created in response to new circumstances, such as the lifela song-poems composed by Sotho migrant workers to express and comment upon the life of miners. Because miners were frequently so far away from home, traditional rituals had to be performed during the weekends or on holidays. Mining companies often sponsored dances as an outlet for the men, and tourists came to view the exotic African musical forms. South African music is a fusion of various musical styles such as traditional indigenous music, jazz, Christian religious music, and forms of popular music from the United States. These combinations are evident in the music of such performers as the African Jazz Pioneers, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, and others. During the apartheid period, Black and white musicians were segregated, although they still collaborated on occasion; a notable example is Johnny Clegg, a white South African who learned traditional Zulu music and formed the mixed-race bands Juluka and Savuka, both of which had international followings. Township music, a lively form of music that flourished in the townships during the apartheid era, has also been popular within the country and abroad.

The army is by far the largest component, and there is a sizable reserve force. Military service is compulsory for all males. South Koreas main military objective is to deter an attack by the North. To that end it has a Mutual Defense Treaty (1953) with the United States, and a large contingent of U.S. troops is stationed in the country. Civilian intelligence gathering and other nonmilitary matters of national security are the responsibility of the National Intelligence Service, formerly called (198199) the Agency for National Security Planning and (196181) the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. Military intelligence is handled by the Defense Security Command. The Korean National Police Agency combines standard police duties with responsibility for counteracting communist infiltration and controlling civil disorders.   Health and welfare The availability of medical services increased enormously after the Korean War, covering the basic needs of the country, including the remote rural areas, to a satisfactory level. Most people now have some sort of medical insurance coverage. Public health and sanitation have greatly improved, thus reducing epidemics. The average life-expectancy rate rose dramatically from the 1950s, while the death rate more than halved. The infant mortality rate also declined sharply. The government provides basic social welfare services: public pensions, unemployment insurance, workers compensation and health insurance, and public assistance. After the Korean War, United Nations agencies, civilian and military agencies of the United States, and private volunteer agencies played a significant role in the steadily improving living conditions in South Korea. Also significant was the dramatic increase in household income, especially among industrial workers. Despite these overall improvements, a disparity still exists between the quality of life of the rural population and that of urban dwellers.   Housing Rapid expansion of urban areas, especially the expansion of Seoul and Pusan, has resulted in considerable changes in the urban landscape. Before 1960 there were few multistory buildings; even in Seoul, most structures were lower than 10 stories. Between 1988 and 1992, in response to a housing shortage created by rapid urbanization, the government sponsored the creation of more than 2.5 million housing units, mostly in the form of apartments. Construction continued at a similar rate in the years immediately following. High-rise buildings, especially apartment blocks, are now common in the cities. By the early 21st century more than half the countrys population lived in apartment buildings. Because of this rapid growth, city services, such as water, transportation, and sewage systems, generally have lagged behind the needs.   Education Six years of primary school education and three years of middle school are compulsory, and virtually all children of school age are enrolled. Nearly all middle-school graduates continue to high school or technical school. About four-fifths of high school graduates go on to higher educational institutions. Graduation from a college or university grew considerably in importance in South Korea after World War II, and the number of college-level institutions increased enormously. Admission to a college or university requires applicants to pass a fiercely competitive entrance examination; high school students must endure grueling preparation work for these examinations, and less than half of high school graduates get the opportunity to study at universities. Nearly all of the most-prestigious schools are located in Seoul; these include the state-run Seoul National University (founded 1946)one of more than a dozen national universities located throughout the countryand the private Korea University (1905), Yonsei University (1885), Ewha Womans University (1886), and Sookmyung Womens University (1906). In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, overseas study, particularly in the United States, grew in popularity.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Silla royal tombs in South KoreaRoyal tombs of the Silla and Unified Silla kingdoms (1st century bcE10th century CE) at Kyngju, South Korea.(more)Shamanism, Buddhism, and Confucianism constitute the background of modern Korean culture. Since World War II, and especially after the Korean War, globalization and rapid political and economic development have had a marked effect on the countrys culture. Traditional thought, however, still plays an important role under the surface. Korea belongs historically to the Chinese cultural realm. After the Three Kingdoms period in particular, Korean culture was strongly influenced by the Chinese, although this influence was given a distinctive Korean stamp. A number of Korean cultural sites have been named UNESCO World Heritage sites. These include the depositories for the Tripitaka Koreana (one of the most complete editions of Buddhist canonical writings in the world), located at Haein Temple, west of Taegu (designated 1995); several dolmen (stone burial monument) sites from the 1st millennium bce in the southwestern part of the country (2000); and the volcanic island of Cheju and its lava-tube cave system (2007).  "},{"CountryName":"South-Sudan","CulturalInfo":"Education of South SudanPrior to Sudans independence in 1956, the British colonial administration had little educational infrastructure established in the southern Sudan, and Christian missionaries assumed responsibility for formal education there. Southern education suffered during Sudans subsequent civil wars (195572; 19832005); the national authorities curtailed missionary activities, attempted to Arabize the southern schools, and, failing that, closed them in 1962. The southern partisans operated schools in the areas they controlled, but their resources were extremely limited. Beginning in the late 1980s, UNICEF coordinated educational instruction efforts in southern Sudan, but limited resources continued to be a stumbling block, as was the ongoing civil conflict, which continued to negatively affect access to schooling. As a result, for decades many southern Sudanese were deprived of the opportunity for an education.\nUnder South Sudans current system, there are two general educational tracks. The formal track includes eight years of primary education, beginning at six years of age, followed by four years of secondary education and then postsecondary training or four years of tertiary education. This track includes a provision for three years of preprimary schooling, but implementation of this option has been slow. An alternative track, in which eight years of primary education are condensed into four years of instruction, exists for students of all ages who have or have had limited access to schooling. English is the language of instruction in South Sudans education system, although indigenous southern Sudanese languages are also used in the early years of primary education. This policy has created some difficulty for a number of teachers, many of whom were trained to teach with Arabic as the language of instruction.\nEven after the 2005 CPA ended the war and amid efforts to increase educational opportunities in the south, only about one-half of school-age children have access to education. For school-age females, access is even more limited, and many drop out within the first few years because of cultural pressures, such as tendency to marry at a young age. In addition, the educational system is further stressed by a lack of school buildings and teaching materials and the limited number of qualified teachers. The educational system was greatly disrupted by the civil war that began in late 2013.\nHigher education in South Sudan is provided by several institutions, including the University of Juba (1977) in the capital, the University of Bahr el Ghazal (1991) in Wau, and Upper Nile University (1991) in Malakal. During the war these universities were relocated in the north for safety reasons; in the years after the CPA, efforts were made to reopen the facilities in the south.\nThe fact that South Sudan, ravaged by decades of civil war, has long been deprived of an adequate education system is evident in its literacy rates, which are among the lowest in the world. Only about one-fourth of adults are able to read. There is a higher rate of literacy in urban areas, where roughly one-half of the adult population is able to read. There is also a discrepancy in literacy rates between men and women: some two-fifths of men are literate, whereas only about one-sixth of women are able to read.\nCultural life\nCultural milieu\nWomen working with beads to create jewelry, Juba, South Sudan.There are many different ethnic groups in South Sudan, each with a long history of customs and traditions. Despite a decades-long attempt by the northern-based national government of Sudan to Arabize the southern region in the 20th century, a rich cultural diversity still exists in South Sudan.\nDaily life and social customs\nSome aspects of South Sudans traditional cultures have weakened with the passage of time. Indeed, the advances of modern society, such as improved communications, opportunities for increased social and economic mobility, and the spread of a money economy, as well as decades of warfare and displacement, have led to a general loosening of the social ties, customs, relationships, and modes of organization in traditional cultures. Still, much from the past remains intact.\nOne of the most important forms of cultural expression among nonliterate groups in South Sudan is oral tradition. It is used as a vehicle for the creative expression of folklore and myths as well as for the recounting of history and traditions. It is also used as a font of guidance and advice for dealing with typical life events. Many South Sudanese groups mark the stages in the life cycle of the individualbirth, circumcision, puberty, marriage, and deathwith ritual and ceremonial practices. Facial scarring and tattooing as methods of ritual adornment are common. Most groups observe patrilineal descent, but the significance of such agnatic ties among kin groups differs from one society to another. Polygyny is practiced in some groups and regarded as a means of extending affinal (in-law) relationships and acquiring support. Although divorce is now common, in the past a broken marriage was considered a shameful thing because it destroyed the network of relationships. Most groups have historically had some form of class distinction.\nCuisine varies throughout the country and among ethnic groups. Grains such as millet and sorghum are popular sources of sustenance and are supplemented by the variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes grown in the country, when available. Fish is a common source of protein among the riverine communities, whereas other groups rely more on meat and milk products from their livestock. A paste made from peanuts may accompany meats and vegetables. Examples of some foods and dishes enjoyed in the country include kisra, a wide flat bread that accompanies many meals, asida, a porridge made from sorghum that is often served with meat or vegetables, and ful, a dish with a basis of mashed fava beans and spices that may have various other foods added to it.\nWestern-style clothing is common, especially in cities and towns. Traditional dress varies throughout the country and among ethnic groups. Because of the hot climate, clothing tends to be loose-fitting and of light material.\nHolidays observed in South Sudan include Sudan Independence Day on January 1 (marking Sudans independence from Great Britain and Egypt in 1956), Peace Agreement Day on January 9 (commemorating the signing of the 2005 CPA), SPLA Day on May 16 (marking the day in 1983 that the southern troops revolted, leading to a resumption in the fight for independence), and Martyrs Day on July 30 (the anniversary of the death of rebel leader John Garang de Mabior, used to commemorate the deaths of all those who died during the long-running civil war). The countrys large Christian population celebrates Easter and Christmas, and Christmas Day is a public holiday in South Sudan.\n"},{"CountryName":"Spain","CulturalInfo":"Housing of SpainDuring the Franco era, housing shortages and standards were a major problem. In 1961 the government passed a National Housing Plan, which resulted in the construction of millions of homes over the next two decades. However, many of these homes were geared to affluent middle-class families; thus, by the 1980s, housing shortages were severe and conditions were still considered poor. After the election of the socialist government in 1982, significant resources were directed at housing. However, population growth continued to outstrip housing construction, and at the beginning of the 21st century many considered housing to be the countrys most pressing social problem. That perception, coupled with low interest rates and an infusion of foreign investment capital, fueled a construction boom that added millions of jobs to the Spanish economy. When the real-estate and construction bubble popped in 2009, thousands of developers went under, and Spains banks were saddled with more than 180 billion (about $225 billion) in toxic assets. More than three-fourths of housing stock is owner-occupied. House types vary from region to region, but by and large multistory dwellings are characteristic of mountain and pastoral districts, while single-story or low houses with courtyards arranged in different ways according to the local economy are typical of the lowlands. Land reform, industrialization, and depopulation have significantly changed the character of many rural districts. In rural areas in particular, the housing stock is relatively old, with more than half of all units built prior to 1960. Increasingly population concentration in urban areas created difficult housing conditions and resulted in the rapid increase in housing prices, exacerbating problems for individuals with low incomes. These prices peaked in 200708, and the subsequent housing bust saw home values drop by as much as 75 percent. Because this adjustment had catastrophic effects on the rest of the economy, few were able to take advantage of the lowered prices, and much of the excess housing stock sat empty. Education Spains first comprehensive public education plan was contained in the Moyano Law of 1857. It remained basically unchanged until 1970, when the General Law on Education was passed. Since then many other education reforms have taken place. The school system has a number of levels: preschool (to age 6), primary school for ages 6 or 7 to 11, secondary school for ages 12 to 16 (which includes technical and vocational schools), baccalaureate school for ages 17 and 18, and university. Education is free and compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 16. Literacy exceeds 95 percent of the population. Historically, the state and the Roman Catholic Church have clashed over education. Spain still has a large private education sector, almost all of which is Catholic, but since the 1960s the predominance of the state has been clearly established, especially in secondary education. In the 1980s the Catholic schools, most of which received substantial subsidies from the state, were subjected to closer government control, and religious education was removed as an obligatory subject. With regional autonomy, control over education in some parts of the country was transferred from the central to regional governments. As a result, the study of Catalan, Galician, and Euskera became obligatory in their respective regions, whereas in the past these languages had not been taught at all. After 1960 there was a dramatic increase in the availability of schooling at all levels. The change was greatest with regard to universities. Until 1960 there were only 12 universities in the country, and higher education was the privilege of a very small elite. By the end of the 20th century, there were more than 60 public and private universities, some of which were operated by the Catholic church. Access to a university education became more democratic as well: in the 1980s almost half of Spains university students had parents who had received no more than an elementary school education. By the early 21st century more than two-thirds of Spains college-age population was attending a university. Among the largest and most-prestigious universities in Spain are the Complutense University of Madrid (founded 1508), the University of Barcelona (1450), the University of Granada (1526), the University of Sevilla (1502), the University of Salamanca (1218), the University of Valencia (1499), and the University of the Basque Country (1968).Cultural life Cultural milieu Spain: AlhambraCourt of the Myrtles in the Alhambra, Granada, Spain, 13th14th century.(more)As in much of western Europe, the culture of Spain was marked decisively by the period of Roman rule. In language, religion, even architectural traditions, the Romans left a lasting legacy. However, the subsequent course of Spanish history added elements to the countrys cultural development that were missing or much weaker in other European countries. The most important differences stem from the Arabic-speaking Muslims from the Middle East and North Africa who invaded Spain in 711 ce and dominated much of the country for almost 800 years. The Muslim cultural influence was very strong, especially in the area of language; indeed, the Spanish language has taken more words from Arabic than from any other source except Latin. Through contact with Muslims, Christian Europe was able to recover much of the cultural and intellectual heritage of Classical antiquity. It also gained access to many scientific advances made by Muslims. Spains cultural mix was further enriched by the presence of a large and influential Jewish population, and medieval Spain witnessed one of the periods of greatest cultural achievement in Jewish history. During the early modern and modern periods, Spains culture was fairly homogeneous. The one significant exception was the presence and persistence of early languages other than Castilian in some parts of the country. Two of these, Catalan and Galician (Gallego), developed significant literary traditions during the Middle Ages. From the 16th century on, however, they lost ground to Castilian and increasingly became limited to everyday use, especially among the peasantry. This had always been the case with the third language, Euskera (Basque), which never had a significant literary tradition. Beginning in the 19th century, all three languages enjoyed a revival. In the 20th century the Franco regime prohibited the public use of languages other than Castilian, but this did not lead to their disappearance. Instead, the use of these languages, both in daily life and in high culture, increased greatly when they became the official languages in the autonomous regions established under the constitution of 1978. They are now taught in the schools and are used in the press and on television and radio. For much of its history, and especially after the Reconquista was completed in 1492, Spain has been strongly identified with the Roman Catholic Church. To a large extent this identification and the virtual religious monopoly that the church has enjoyed since the 16th century have been artificially imposed. Members of the two large religious minorities were forced to convert or leave the country: the Jews in 1492 and the Muslims in 1502. From 1478 until 1834 religious uniformity was enforced by the church court, the Inquisition. In the 19th and 20th centuries the Roman Catholic Church sought to have, and for much of that time succeeded in having, the government declare Roman Catholicism as the state religion, even though a large part of the population was nonpracticing or even anticlerical. The church also encouraged the government to limit or even prohibit the practice of other faiths. State support for the Catholic church was strongest during the Franco regime, but since 1978 Spain has had no official religion. Today Spaniards enjoy complete freedom of religion, although Roman Catholicism remains an important cultural influence. Thus, at the beginning of the 21st century, the expression of cultural diversity is easier than it was for at least 500 years. Ironically, this came at the same time that Spain became increasingly drawn into a homogeneous global culture. "},{"CountryName":"Sri-Lanka","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life Kiri Vihara StupaKiri Vihara Stupa, Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka.(more)Sri Lanka is a land of great cultural diversity. Religion pervades many aspects of life and constitutes a basic element of this diversity. Buddhist and Hindu temples, as well as mosques and churches, with their own colourful rituals, are the most readily visible features of the cultural landscape. Varying degrees of colonial impact, modernizing influences, and wealth and income add other shades to the cultural mosaic.  The arts In architecture, sculpture, and painting, Sri Lankas traditions extend far back into antiquity. The remnants of ancient works restored and preserved at archaeological sites, while reflecting Indian influences, also bear testimony to the inspiration derived from Buddhism. Classical literature, too, presents a blend of stylistic influences from India with Buddhist themes. Since the beginning of the 20th century, with the literati being exposed to European literature, local creative writing has acquired greater diversity in style and has become more secular in content. In the performing arts there are several Sinhalese and Tamil folk traditions and a host of recent imports and imitations. Among the folk dance forms, for example, one finds the highly refined Kandyan dancing, which has been associated over several centuries with state ceremony and religious ritual in and around the historic hill capital of Kandy. The more improvised devil dancing is performed at healing rites and exorcisms. In drama, modernized versions of folk theatre share the limelight with modern original works and adaptations from Western dramatists. Both Indian and Western influences are strongly apparent in the popular forms of music.   Cultural institutions Government assistance to the arts is channeled through several institutions under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. Art, music, and dancing are included in the school curriculum. Advanced training in these and several other fields of fine arts is provided at the Government College of Fine Arts, the Institute of Aesthetic Studies, and several private institutions. The Department of National Archives and the National Museum, both in Colombo, are the main repositories of historical documents and archaeological treasures of the country.   Recreation Many internationally recognized sports have found participants in Sri Lanka. The most popular among them are volleyball, cricket, football (soccer), bicycle racing, and various water sports. Sri Lanka: ancient city of SigiriyaThe rock pillar upon which are the ruins of an ancient stronghold, Sigiriya, central Sri Lanka, designated a World Heritage site in 1982.(more)The sites of ancient cities and other religiocultural centres such as Anuradhapura, Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa, Kandy, Kataragama, and Adams Peak attract thousands of tourists and pilgrims.   Press and broadcasting Print and broadcast media reach all parts of the country in Sinhala, Tamil, and English. The government controls radio and television broadcasting and several widely circulated daily newspapers. Several private daily and weekly newspapers operate independently of the government and exercise considerable freedom of expression. However, the government is empowered to impose censorship under the Public Security Act. Gerald Hubert Peiris  "},{"CountryName":"Sudan","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life  Cultural milieu The key to an understanding of contemporary Sudanese culture is diversity. Each major ethnic group and historical region has its own special forms of cultural expression.   Traditional cultures Because of Sudans great cultural diversity, it is difficult to classify the traditional cultures of the various peoples. Sudans traditional societies have diverse linguistic, ethnic, social, cultural, and religious characteristics. And, although improved communications, increased social and economic mobility, and the spread of a money economy have led to a general loosening of the social ties, customs, relationships, and modes of organization in traditional cultures, much from the past still remains intact. The following discussion of three of those cultures merely suggests some rather prominent cultural patterns that are illustrative of the wide range present. These three cultures are those of the Fur, Muslim Africans in the far western part of the country; the Humr tribe of the Baqqrah Arabs, of west-central Sudan; and the Otoro tribe of the Nuba, in east-central Sudan.  Social organization  Political and territorial organization Broadly speaking, the traditional societies of Sudan exhibited two types of political organization: the hierarchical system of the Fur and the segmentary systems of the Humr Baqqrah and Otoro. The Fur, for example, had a centralized political and administrative structure. There was a sultan at the head of the state, which was divided into four regions in turn divided into districts, subdistricts, and villages. Each village had a council of elders who decided minor cultivation disputes and enforced their decisions by advice and warning. The rights of the village were vested in its inhabitants jointly. Ultimate authority lay with the sultan, who could depose officials beneath him when their power became a threat to his dominance. In contrast, the Humr Baqqrah had a political system based on a segmentary lineage organization. The tribe was divided into two sections, each of which was divided into a further five sections, each comprising major lineages, camps, and extended families. All these groups had potential leaders. The significant residential and herding unit was the camp, the composition of which changed with the seasons. Within each tribe and at every level, there was a process of splitting, migration, and resettling that resulted in a continuous change of alliance among groups and individuals. Blood feuds occurred between segments and were settled by payment of blood money. Power among the Humr Baqqrah stemmed from wealth and strength of personality. The Otoro political system consisted of a number of territorial segments that did not coincide with kinship groupings. Clan members were scattered in different localities; the basic political unit was the hill community, whose members shared a tract of land and a common code of morality. Feuding between hill communities was constant, but members of the same hill community could not kill one another. The Otoro recognized tribal boundaries defined by periodically renewed intertribal treaties. Because of the continual raids and wars between segments, a chieftainship, with the power to use force to maintain peace, was established.   Family and kinship patterns In all the societies descent was reckoned in the male line, but the significance of such agnatic ties among kin groups differed from one society to another. The Fur reckoned descent patrilineally, but residence was customarily with or near the wifes parents. However, if a husband disagreed with his in-laws, he could take his wife to live with his own group. Cousin marriage, sororate (customary marriage with a deceased wifes sister), levirate (customary marriage to an elder brothers widow), and polygyny were practiced. Among the Humr Baqqrah, members of the smallest lineage (surra), together with their dependents, formed a single camp. The organization of a surra depended on the number of cattle and the distribution of their ownership among the surras members. Each surra had a leader who was wealthy but who had no administrative functions unless he was already a member of the local government. Whereas members of a camp formed the basic unit of cooperation over herding, the household was the main unit of cooperation in agriculture, although some activities connected with agriculture involved a wider group. Preferred marriage within the surra was with a parallel cousin. Many first marriages, contracted to conform to the expectation of elders, ended in divorce, but in subsequent marriages partners could be freely chosen. Among the Otoro there were patrilineal clans of various size. With the exception of the Chungur clan, which was the traditional holder of the hereditary chieftainship, all clans were socially of equal order. Clan members intermarried with each other, although clan exogamy was formerly the rule. In the economic and religious spheres, the clan did not exercise influence, but it did impose upon its members the collective duty of blood feud in the case of homicide between clans. Patrilineal descent was important in determining the social identity of a person, inheritance, and rights and duties concerning marriage and bridewealth (gifts from the groom and his kinsmen to the father of the bride and his kinsmen). Although the Otoro were patrilineal, matrilineal ties were also important. Polygyny and leviratic marriages were practiced, and bridewealth payments established wider contact between social groups. Divorce was negotiated and settled by the families concerned. The marriage was usually dissolved by the total refund of the bridewealth to the former husband.   Social stratification All the groups had some form of class distinction. The highest political office among the Fur was that of the sultan, who was surrounded by a body of councillors dependent on royal patronage. Locally, there was a descending hierarchy of hereditary fief stewards, village heads, and, lastly, heads of households. Ironworkers were a despised class not allowed to intermarry with ordinary Fur. Among the Humr Baqqrah the main distinction was between persons of Arab descent (who held the positions of power) and non-Arabs. In other respects, a persons wealth and personality determined his successful bid for leadership. Traditionally, among the Otoro there were no political offices, only a special hereditary ritual officethat of chief of the Path, who acted as intermediary in peace negotiations between conflicting parties. Today, however, there are chiefs selected by the local government from among persons of local wealth and importance. In addition there were age-grades; membership in each of the five grades lasted three years, after which all the members were promoted together to the next higher grade. Promotion was marked with festivities, and members of each age-grade lived separately. This system marked the development of a person from an ordinary youth to that of a big man. Girls also formed age-grade groups.   Socialization and education In all societies under comparison, there were ritual and ceremonial practices marking the stages in the life cycle of the individualbirth, circumcision, puberty, marriage, and death. Circumcision distinguished boyhood from manhood. Among the Otoro, an individual achieved higher status as he was promoted from one age-grade to another. There was also an association of cicatrization (scarring) with a test of manhood: killing an enemy entitled a person to have a small pattern of scars on his back. Similar patterns were also made on the upper arms of successful hunters. Men took part in wrestling and fighting as part of their training for manhood. There was little formal education among the Otoro, Humr Baqqrah, and Fur. Among the Nuba there were very few schools at the elementary level. Education made little headway among the Humr Baqqrah because it came into conflict with their way of life; people were reluctant to send their children to schools because livestock and cattle herding would suffer. There were a few Qurnic schools among the Fur, in which elementary Arabic, arithmetic, and the Qurn were taught.   "},{"CountryName":"Suriname","CulturalInfo":"Government and society Constitutional framework Suriname: Government HouseGovernment House, Paramaribo, Suri.(more)Under the 1987 constitution, legislative power is exercised by the popularly elected 51-member unicameral National Assembly, which in turn elects a president and vice president. The president, vice president, and members of the National Assembly serve five-year terms. The president is the chairman of a nonelective, military-influenced Council of State, which ensures that the governments actions conform to the law. It has constitutional powers to annul laws passed by the National Assembly. The judicial system consists of a Court of Justice and cantonal courts. Suriname is a member of the Caribbean Court of Justice, the final court of appeal for Caribbean Community members. Local government Local government was established in Suriname in 1987. It is divided into distrikten (districts) and ressorten (subdistricts). Each district has a representative and an executive branch of government. The former are run by district raden (district councils), and the latter are administered by districtsbestuur (district administrations). At the subdistrict level there is only a representative branch managed by ressort raad (subdistrict councils). Both the district and subdistrict councils are elected every five years at the countrys general elections. Political process Universal suffrage was introduced in 1948; Surinamese citizens age 18 and older are allowed to vote. Political mobilization and party affiliation have evolved along strongly ethnic lines. South Asians, Creoles, and Javanese all have played major roles in the development of the countrys constitutional democracy. The Progressive Reform Party (Vooruitstrvende Hervormde Partij; VHP) is a leading Hindu party; the Suriname National Party (Nationale Partij Suriname; NPS) was founded by Creoles; and the Pendawa Lima (Five Sons of King Pandu) is a predominately Javanese party. The Surinamese Liberation Army (SLA), a guerrilla group better known as the Jungle Commando and consisting mainly of Maroons, formed in 1986 with the intent to overthrow the standing government. In retaliation, the National Army carried out raids in Maroon villages. The killing and detaining of many Maroons resulted in the flight of many to French Guiana. After a formal peace agreement was reached in 1992, most of them returned to Suriname, where they control economic activity on their lands. Health and welfare Health conditions are relatively good in Suriname. Most tropical diseases are combated effectively. Medical care in the interior is provided by the Foundation for Medical Mission of the Evangelical Brethren in Suriname, which operates medical centres in the larger Maroon and Indian settlements. Most of the population has health insurance. All collective labour agreements include medical care. The unemployed and workers in the informal sector, however, must obtain a special certificate  from the government to receive free medical care. Unemployment benefits and other social provisions are almost nonexistent. Education About nine-tenths of Surinamese age 15 and older are literate. Surinames system of education is modeled on that of the Netherlands, and Dutch is the language of instruction. School attendance is compulsory for children up to age 12, and education at all levels is free. More than nine-tenths of the children in the coastal areas attend primary school. Suriname has secondary schools, junior colleges, a teachers college, and vocational and technical schools. The Anton de Kom University of Suriname, founded in 1968 as the University of Suriname, has faculties of law, medicine, social science and economics, engineering, and natural resources.Cultural life Cultural milieu Suriname is a culturally diverse society, with harmonious contact between its ethnic groups in the cultural sphere. Fine arts, such as painting and sculpture, were traditionally middle-class concerns dominated by Western cultural standards, but since independence the works of artists from different ethnic groups have received more recognition. Culinary traditions cross ethnic lines, and elements from South Asian, Javanese, Creole, Western African, and Chinese cuisine are often blended. The arts Surinames art forms derive from several ethnic traditions. Those of Javanese descent, for example, support a number of gamelan (Indonesian orchestra) troupes. Surinames Indians and Maroons developed a strong crafts industry, producing colourful textiles, baskets, and wood carvings for export. Most Surinamese writing is in the Dutch, Sranan, and Hindi languages. Among the countrys leading writers are Albert Helman, whose published works include dozens of volumes of fiction and plays; Martinus Haridat Luchtman, who, under the pen name Shrinivasi, is the author of several books of poems; Astrid Roemer, a popular novelist; and Cynthia McLeod, who has written several historical novels that have earned a wide readership in both Suriname and the Netherlands. Surinamese music is represented by musical groups such as Fra Fra Bigband, an orchestra from Paramaribo that blends indigenous forms of kaseko (dance music combining Western march, jazz, and calypso), kawina (a type of Creole pop music), and winti (ritual music) to form a distinctly Surinamese brand of Afro-Caribbean jazz. In recent years, Suriname-based groups also have collaborated with Western African musicians, adding talking drums and thumb pianos (lamellaphones) to their instrumentation. Sports and recreation The countrys most popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, and volleyball. Although Suriname has no professional sports teams, several Surinamese players have become members of well-known European soccer clubs. Suriname made its Olympic debut at the 1968 Mexico City Games. Surinames Anthony Nesty won the gold medal in the 100-metre butterfly competition at the 1988 Seoul Games and later earned a bronze in the same event at the 1992 Barcelona Games. Fishing is a common recreational sport, particularly from August to October, when many people fish with bamboo poles in freshwater swamps and creeks. Hunting is also popular. A traditional Surinamese activity is birdkeeping. The most commonly caught birds are the large-billed seed finches (Oryzoborus crassirostris) known in the country as twa-twas. A competition among these whistling birds takes place Sunday mornings at Independence Square in Paramaribo and in other cities throughout Suriname. Media and publishing All non-government-owned media were shut down in 1982. However, since then several private entities resumed operation. The major independent daily newspapers are De Ware Tijd (The True Times) and De West (The West); both are printed in Dutch. Most of the government-owned television and radio stations broadcast in Dutch, and some also air in local languages. There are a large number of smaller commercial radio stations."},{"CountryName":"Sweden","CulturalInfo":" Education of SwedenThe education system is, with few exceptions, public and open to all without fees. Primary schools are run by the municipalities, as are the secondary schools. Universities and colleges are administered by the state, but they have been given far-reaching autonomy in the use of resources. Academic freedom is carefully guarded by faculty and students alike. All municipalities must provide preschool classes. Parents may choose whether or not to send their children, and the great majority does participate. Parents and pupils have the choice of free municipal schools as well as independent schools, which may charge tuition. Only a very small percentage of all Swedish children attend private or independent schools. The comprehensive school (grundskola) is compulsory for nine years. Children are required to attend school between the ages of 7 and 16. Compulsory education is free, and no charge is made for school lunches, transportation, or educational materials. The comprehensive school is divided into three-year stages: lower, middle, and upper. Each school may decide when English and other foreign languages are introduced, but all must meet the same standards by grade 5. About one-third of all schools begin English instruction in grade 1. From the seventh year the curriculum is divided into different lines chosen by the pupils themselves. Special education is given to all pupils suffering from physical or mental handicaps. Nearly all of the pupils continue from comprehensive school to the upper secondary school. The curriculum in this school (gymnasieskola) is divided between several theoretical programs, which are university-oriented, and a variety of vocationally oriented programs. Certain core subjects are common to all programs. Marks, or grades, are given in comprehensive school starting in the eighth year. In the upper secondary school grades are given each term. About half of all young people in Sweden go on to higher studies within five years of completing upper secondary school. Sweden has about a dozen major universities and some 20 university-colleges. The oldest is the Uppsala University, founded in 1477. Other universities are located in Lund, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Ume, Linkping, Karlstad and Vxj. Sweden is also home to other world-renowned institutions, including the Karolinska Institute (medicine) in Stockholm and the Chalmers University of Technology. Education is free of charge; students pay no tuition. Courses are typically taught in Swedish, but course literature is often in English. An increasing number of courses are also offered in English. Continuing and adult education are important features of the Swedish education system. Adult education outside the public school system is offered at the many Folk High Schools, a uniquely Scandinavian educational institution. Also characteristic are the nationwide voluntary education associations. About half of Swedens adult population pursues studies in one form or another. Since 1968 municipalities have offered courses for adults covering the three upper grades of comprehensive school and upper secondary school. University courses also are open to all age groups. Distance learningincluding radio and television courses, as well as Internet and correspondence coursesis popular and especially useful for persons who reside far from educational centres.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Swedens cultural heritage is an interweaving of a uniquely Swedish sensibility with ideas and impulses taken from other, larger cultures. As a result, Swedish culture has long been characterized by a push and pull. Swedish art, poetry, literature, music, textiles, dance, and design are deeply infused with a primal relationship with the Nordic landscape and climate, but Swedes also have long been attracted to the greatness of the cultures of such countries as France and Germany, and influences from these and other European cultures have contributed to the development of Swedish literature, fashion, and cultural debate, as well as to the Swedish language itself. As Swedish political influence grew, particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, so did a desire among prominent Swedes for their country to take a place at centre stage with other important European cultures. This refusal to be classified as a cultural backwater remains a strong force today. At the same time, simplicity is a hallmark of Swedish culture, as is openness to new thoughts and trends. There is also a sense of wit and playfulness combined with candor and sincerity that is apparent not only in the works of Swedish cultural icons such as Selma Lagerlf, August Strindberg, Ingmar Bergman, Astrid Lindgren, and Carl Larsson but also in Swedish folk music and folk art. War-weary and largely nonaligned since the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century, Sweden embraced a neutrality and peacefulness that permitted the state in the 20th century to broadly support arts and culture politically, educationally, and economically. During the last half of the 20th century, Sweden welcomed immigrants and refugees who brought with them their own cultural traditions, which have informed the broader Swedish culture. The effects of American popular culture have also been widely felt in Sweden. A rebirth of contemporary Swedish creativity has attracted worldwide attention both in those art forms in which Swedes have traditionally thrivedliterature and filmand in design, popular music, photography, fashion, gastronomy, and textiles.  "},{"CountryName":"Switzerland","CulturalInfo":"Health and welfare Public welfare services in Switzerland have evolved in a way typical of federalism, developing first in the communes, then in the cantons, and later in the confederation. Social welfare support is primarily a communal task, sometimes in cooperation with the cantons. Social insurance, which had existed in some communes, was introduced at the federal level by a series of constitutional amendments, the most important of which was compulsory social-security insurance (introduced in 1948). Financed through the contributions of workers and their employers, as well as smaller contributions from the cantons and the confederation, social-security insurance provides annuities and pension allowances to senior citizens (men over 65 and women over 62) and to widows, orphans, and invalids. Because this legislation did not cover the cost of living, a system of mandatory occupational pensions was later introduced, financed by both employers and employees. In 1985 a voluntary employee-funded private pension plan was established, encouraged by tax incentives. Unemployment insurance is federal, financed by contributions from employees and employers. Health insurance is compulsory; though a legal framework has been established on the federal level, the health system is largely organized along cantonal lines, and health contributions vary considerably between cantons. The Swiss Confederation and the cantons together finance additional support for the destitute out of general revenues. Overall, the level of social welfare spending is substantial, accounting for more than one-fourth of total expenditures, and care and services are among the best in the world. Drug use is considered an important health problem, with many youths regularly using marijuana and other drugs. To resolve drug-related issues, Switzerland adopted a unique approach, controlling drug delivery to the severely addicted without legalizing drugs. The strategy has resulted in better care for addicts, a reduction in the drug-abuse rate, and an increase in public safety. Housing Because of its distinct cultural differences, Switzerland provides varied examples of geographic settlement patterns, with traditional housing types differing from one region to another. For example, smooth stone houses are typical in the Engadin, small stone buildings in Ticino, the combination house and barn in the Mittelland, the distinctive shingled facades in Appenzell, and the wooden villages of the valleys of Valais canton. The housing stock in Switzerland is relatively modern, with more than two-thirds built since 1947. Despite the countrys high population density, dwellings are fairly large; about one-fourth of homes have more than five rooms. With about one-third of all dwellings owner occupied, Switzerland has among the lowest home ownership rates in Europe. This low figure is partially the result of the countrys high population density and scarce land, which has inflated the value of land, combined with an unequal income distributionfactors that have made it impossible for a majority of the population to acquire a dwelling. Education Rolex Learning Center; Lausanne, SwitzerlandThe Rolex Learning Center at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland.(more)Switzerlands 1874 constitution gave sovereignty over education to each canton or demicanton. Elementary education is free and compulsory between the ages of 7 and 16. The confederation provides financial assistance for vocational training and the cantonal universities, regulates examinations for the professions, and influences the curriculum of the secondary schools. The only institutions of higher education maintained by the confederation itself are the Federal Institutes of Technology at Zrich (founded 1855) and Lausanne (founded 1853 and federalized 1969). Among the countrys most prominent institutions are the Universities of Basel (founded 1460), Bern (established as a seminary in 1528 and as a university in 1834), Geneva (founded 1559), Lausanne (founded 1537), and Zrich (founded 1833). The interior department in Bern administers education, and there is an education department in every canton. The combination of an Alpine landscape, the pedagogic reputation of educational theorists such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, and Jean Piaget, and the multicultural nature of the country has prompted many private schools, at all levels, to locate in Switzerland.Cultural life Cultural milieu men playing alphornsMen in traditional attire playing alphorns in the Swiss Alps, Zermatt, Switzerland.(more)Although Switzerland is small and relatively isolated from more well-recognized cultural centres, it nevertheless can boast an impressive list of contributors to the arts and sciences. For example, Switzerland has won more Nobel Prizes and registered more patents per capita than any other country, and the country abounds in cultural institutions, museums, and libraries, all well supported with federal funds. However, because of limited opportunities at home, some of Switzerlands most creative mindsfor example, architect Le Corbusier and painter Paul Kleewent elsewhere to work. On the other hand, Switzerlands traditional neutrality and its laws of political asylum have made the country a magnet for many creative persons during times of unrest or war in Europe. For example, writers such as the English poet George Byron, the Irish novelist James Joyce, the Romanian-born French poet Tristan Tzara, and the French writer Voltaire resided in Switzerland, and, in the 1930s and 40s, the rise of fascism caused a number of German, Austrian, and Italian writers such as Thomas Mann, Stefan George, and Ignazio Silone to seek harbour in Switzerland. Switzerlands geographic centrality in Europe is reflected in its role as Helvetia mediatrix (Switzerland the mediator). The spirit of Henri Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, lives on in the continued sense of a distinct mission of cultural union that is shared by many Swiss, a mission also revealed in the countrys extensive foreign-assistance programs for less-developed countries. Since the 1990s, with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the bipolar division of the world, Switzerland has had to reevaluate and redefine this traditional role. It can no longer serve as a go-between for the major power blocs; instead, international peace initiatives are often now embedded in institutions such as the UN or the EU, and, until it joined the UN in 2002, Switzerland was a member of neither. If a Swiss culture can be spoken of in its broader implications beyond the arts, distinctive French, Italian, and German cultural circles must be recognized, as well as a Rhaeto-Romanic culture, which has been threatened by the increasing influence of the German language in the Romansh parts of eastern Switzerland, spread largely through the medium of television. It is mostly the common political and institutional visionsfederalism, direct democracy, individualism, and the will not to be dominated by the surrounding large, often centralist countriesthat both unite the Swiss and constitute their culture. Some see the influence of the mass media as a threat to Swiss culture and tradition, both because of its homogenizing effects and because the different language groups can now receive and be influenced by television and radio in their respective cultural hearths of Germany, France, and Italy. These critics stress the important role of the national radio and television corporation in maintaining and nurturing a common understanding among all Swiss. "},{"CountryName":"Syria","CulturalInfo":"Local government Syria is divided into governorates (one of which, Damascus, is a governorate-level city), maniq (districts), and naw (subdistricts). The governors, or mufin, enjoy some power within their administrative divisions, but local government is centralized and is dependent upon the minister of the interior in the national government. Justice The principles of Syrian law and equity derive basically from Islamic jurisprudence and secondarily from the French civil code. Summary courts try civil, commercial, and penal cases. The headquarters of each administrative district has a First Instance Court for criminal cases. The capital city of each governorate also has a court of appeal. Damascus houses a high court of appeal and a constitutional court, as well as a military tribunal and the muftis court for the maintenance of Islamic law. Various non-Muslim sects each have their own courts with jurisdiction over personal-status cases. Political process Most authority is wielded by the ruling Arab Socialist Baath Party. Since its foundation in the 1940s, the party has undergone radical internal changes as a result of successive coups dtat and internal power struggles. The party has branch organizations in many Arab countries, each headed by its own regional leadership. The organs of administration are the National Command, the Regional Command, and the Peoples Council; the latter operates as a legislature. The supreme national leadership is composed of representatives from each regional branch, who are elected by their own party congresses. The regional leadership for Syria is the highest authority in the country but is subordinate to the national leadership. Actual power resides in the presidency. All political parties are officially linked together as the National Progressive Front, which is dominated by the Baath Party. Although Syria has universal adult suffrage, elections are generally not held by international observers as free and fair. Women are able to participate in the political system and have held a number of positions, and in the early 21st century almost one-eighth of the members of parliament were women. The Alawites, one of Syrias religious minorities, have dominated Syrian politics since the 1960s. Security Military service is compulsory for all adult males; college students receive deferments. Military service provides general and technicalas well as militaryeducation and training. The army is the largest contingent of Syrias armed forces and is responsible for defense, public works, road construction, and public health. There is also an air force, a small navy, and reserve units for all three branches. Palestinian Arab guerrilla organizations operate from Syria and have training facilities there. Health and welfare Most endemic diseases in Syria have been eliminated. Health facilities include state and private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as hospitals and outpatient clinics of the armed forces. There are also a number of public and private outpatient clinics, as well as maternal and child-care, antituberculosis, malaria eradication, and rural health centres. Child mortality is caused mostly by measles and diseases of the digestive and respiratory systems. Tuberculosis and trachoma are widespread, particularly among the Bedouin, peasants, and residents of poorer urban areas. Health conditions and sanitation in the cities, towns, and larger villages are generally satisfactory. Running water is supplied to almost all houses, buildings, and public places. Each municipality maintains its streets and collects refuse regularly. Although the government has offered incentives for doctors to serve rural areas, medical services are unevenly distributed, with the majority of doctors concentrated in the large cities. The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour is empowered to find work for, and distribute cash allowances to, the unemployed. The ministry also encourages such youth activities as athletics, scouting, literacy campaigns, and the organization of cooperatives. The government gives substantial grants to private welfare societies. The high birth rate in Syria has caused family lands to be broken up into ever smaller lots and has reduced the standard of living of many rural inhabitants. Housing The old houses in Damascus are built of soft unbaked bricks, wood, and stone. Contemporary buildings are built of concrete, while hewn stone is reserved for official buildings, mosques, and churches. The pace of change from an agricultural to an industrial economy, and the accompanying migration to the cities, led to an acute shortage of housing. Aggravating the shortage, young adult males migrating from rural areas to the cities are increasingly breaking with tradition by leaving their parental homes for their own. The Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs undertakes the construction of blocks of low-income flats in the cities. Education About four-fifths of the Syrian population is literate. Schooling, which begins at age six, is divided into six years of compulsory primary, three years of lower secondary, and three years of upper secondary education. Lower and upper secondary schools provide general (which prepares for university entrance) or vocational curricula. Secondary schools are open to all elementary students who wish to continue their education. Within this framework, increased attention is being given to technical education. The University of Damascus, founded in 1923, is the countrys oldest university. Other universities include the University of Aleppo (1960), Tishrn University (1971) in Latakia, and Al-Baath University (1979) in Homs. All levels of education have been expanded substantially since 1963.Cultural life Contemporary Syrian culture blends Arab, Mediterranean, and European elements. Syrians are keenly interested in international politics and culture, which many follow through national radio and television programs as well as those broadcast from other Middle Eastern countries and from Europe. The Ministry of Culture and National Guidance has been active in directing and promoting the nations cultural life. An important objective has been the affirmation of the Arab national character in the face of foreign cultural influences. "},{"CountryName":"Taiwan","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life  Cultural milieu Taipei: National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial HallThe main entrance gate to the National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Taipei.(more)Taiwans culture may be described as traditional and conservative, like most other Asian cultures but to a greater degree. It is mainly Chinese in origin and is patriarchal and patrilineal, with the family at the centre of cultural activities. The society is hierarchical and class-oriented, though it is egalitarian in the sense that one has the opportunity to advance socially through education. In theory, at the top of the traditional social ladder were the scholars, followed by peasants, workers, merchants, and soldiers. Merchants often bought into the scholarly class. Soldiers rose in class status during times of invasion or war. Taiwans culture, however, has also been influenced by traditional Japanese culture, which was more clan-oriented and feudal and gave high status to the military (traditionally, the samurai class). It has also been influenced by the culture of aboriginal peoples, which is tribe-oriented. Because of the less-settled environment in Taiwan, the Chinese who migrated there placed more importance on security and on business and less on education. Also different from the mainland was the lesser degree of importance given to such factors as the control of water and, with it, the need for a strong central government. The people of Taiwan highly regard their culture and like to advertise it. The government also considers support for cultural activities to be one of its important roles. After 1945 that took the form of eradicating Japanese cultural elements and promoting Chinese ones instead. Notable since the 1990s has been its support for the cultural activities of various ethnic groups. Taiwan is unusual in that its constitution guarantees expenditures for such support.   Family structure A patriarchal and patrilineal extended family was the traditional pattern for the Chinese population on Taiwan. The aboriginal system was tribal. Both have been influenced by Taiwans modernization process, in which the family has been reduced in size and has become more urban and less cohesive. The Hakkas have maintained a more-traditional family structure, having been influenced less by the Japanese. Mainland Chinese have been more affixed to the traditional family, but they have also been more affected by modernization. By 1980 more than half the families in Taiwan were nuclear and only one-fourth of them extended. Family size continued to shrink as the proportion of the population that was urban grew and became more transientfactors that further weakened the traditional family structure. Also of note were the emergence of a generation gap and a large and increasing number of women entering the workforce, which helped to undermine the family-centred social system. Although there have been profound changes in the traditional family structure in Taiwan, Taiwans society is still more family-oriented than most. Filial piety is still practiced. The family still plays a role in marriages and in many social events, and it remains the focus of its members loyalty and identification. In addition, businesses continue to be largely family-owned and family-run.   Daily life and social customs squid being grilledSquid being grilled at a street market, Taiwan.(more)Daily life in Taiwan is to a considerable extent oriented toward ones family, job, and education. The degree of each depends on a persons age, status in the society, and individual circumstances. Women and children are closer to the family, although with a larger number of working women that has become less the case. Children spend much of their time studying, much more than children in the West. Competition to get into the best universities begins early. Stability within the household is of great importance. Ritual and role-playing are stronger than in most other cultures. Respect for elders is considered vital, as is loyalty toward the family. Eating is a central part of the culture, and people in Taiwan are proud of their cuisine. At home, meals bring the family together and last longer than in many other societies. Citizens also like to dine out and spend more of their time and money at restaurants than in most cultures. Taiwans cuisine is considered to be one of the best in the world. Its variety is also notable, as dishes from all parts of China can be found on the island.  bubble teaGlasses of bubble tea with various colours and flavours. (more)Taiwans bubble teaa beverage combining tea, milk, and bubbles (chewy gelatinous candies made of tapioca or fruit jelly)has become internationally famous. It originated in Tai-nan in the mid-1980s but quickly spread to other areas of the country, becoming a popular after-school or after-work treat from tea shops or street vendors. The drink then spread internationally in the 2000s, introduced by Chinese diaspora populations in places such as New York, London, and Berlin, and even appeared on the menus of fast-food restaurant chains such as Dunkin and McDonalds.  As Taiwan modernized, and especially as it became democratized, more people began to take an interest in politics. Many have participated in various ways, including joining campaigns, voting, and protesting. Large numbers of people have also begun spending more time at events in their companies, schools, and social clubs and at national events. Taipei: National DayWomen marching during National Day festivities, Taipei.(more)National holidays are widely observed. The Chinese (lunar) New Year is the most important. Citizens return home if they can, spend time with family members, eat, and talk. Traditionally, they are expected to pay their debts and to renew their lives. The Dragon Boat Festival (in the spring), the Mid-Autumn Festival, and National Day on October 10 are other important holidays.   The arts Taipei: National TheatreActor applying makeup, National Theatre, Taipei.(more)The arts or, more broadly, the culture of Taiwan has been influenced by aboriginal peoples, Chinese culture brought by immigrants, the brief period of Western colonial rule, Chinese governance, Japanese rule, and Westernization since World War II. The post-1945 government made special efforts to promote Chinese culture (including provisions for it in the constitution). Special efforts were made to eradicate the Japanese cultural influence. Chiang Kai-shek favoured calligraphy, classical painting, traditional Chinese opera, and the folk arts. Taiwanese art forms included puppet shows, sculpture, and dance. National Palace MuseumNational Palace Museum, Taipei.(more)The government operates a variety of museums and other cultural and arts centres that advance Chinese culture. The National Palace Museum on the outskirts of Taipei (opened 1965) is considered to have one of the worlds best collections of Chinese antiquities. It contains many valuable historical artifacts, works of art, and books that were taken to Taiwan from China in 1949. The Juming Museum in the Chin-shan (Jinshan) district of New Taipei City provides exhibits of contemporary art. The National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in Tai-chung (Taizhong) houses works from the Ming and Qing (Ching) dynasties. The National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in central Taipei contains items from more-recent Chinese history. It forms part of a complex that includes an opera house and a concert hall. Democratization has been accompanied by more eclecticism in the arts and has led to the exploration of new themes, such as pragmatism, realism, and nativism. Japanese cultural elements have had a revival, especially the martial arts, and Japanese movies have become popular in Taiwan. Western culture has grown in influence, especially in movies, music, literature, and fashions. After 1987, when citizens were allowed to visit China, that access spurred a revival of interest in mainland Chinese literature and arts.  "},{"CountryName":"Tajikistan","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life The area now called Tajikistan has an ancient culture, and many popular traditions and customs have been retained. Daily life and social customs Tajik cuisine has noticeable similarities to others in the region, including rice, bread, and meat as staples and the use of subtle spices. Meals begin with drinks, usually green tea, and a spread of fruits, nuts, and sweets. Traditional dishes include osh, seasoned rice with meat and carrots or turnips, and qurutob, which is made by pouring cheese over fatir bread and topping it with onions or other vegetables. Non bread accompanies meals and is treated with significant respectit cannot be dropped, turned upside down, or have anything placed on top of it. Tajikistanis celebrate both cultural and religious holidays. The New Year celebration, known as Navrz (Nrz),  begins on March 21, during the period of the vernal equinox. Smaller festivals are celebrated upon the first flowering of snowdrops and tulips in the spring. Religious celebrations include Idi Ramazon (see Eid al-Fitr) and Idi Qurbon (see Eid al-Adha). International Womens Day is a national holiday in Tajikistan. Literature Writers from this region have made notable contributions to literature since the 10th century ce, and a vigorous folk literature continues. Tajik literature stems from a broader Persian literary tradition that can be traced back to the poet Rdak. Tajiks consider the Shh-nmeh to be the national epic and cherish the work of Rm. A number of Tajik poets and novelists achieved fame during the 20th century. They included Abdalrauf Fitrat, whose dialogues Munazr (1909; The Dispute) and Qiyamt (1923; Last Judgment) have been reprinted many times in Tajik, Russian, and Uzbek, and Sadriddin Ayni, known for his novel Dokhunda (1930; The Mountain Villager) and for his autobiography, Yoddoshtho (194954; published in English as Bukhara). Both Fitrat and Ayni were bilingual, writing in Uzbek and Tajik. Ab al-Qsim Lhts poem Taj va bayraq (1935; Crown and Banner) and Mirzo Tursunzades Hasani arobakash (1954; Hasan the Cart Driver) responded to the changes of the Soviet era. The latters lyric cycle Sadoyi Osiyo (1956; The Voice of Asia) won major communist awards. A number of female writers, notably the popular poet Gulrukhsor Safieva, circulated their work in newspapers, magazines, and Tajik-language collections. Cultural institutions The Tajik National Theatre, which was established in 1929, long presented opera, ballet, musical comedy, and puppetry. Regional theatres and troupes later appeared in towns such as Nau. Tajik studios have produced feature films and documentaries and have dubbed films from elsewhere. Radio and television services expanded during the later decades of Soviet rule, and Dushanbe has had a television centre since 1960. Broadcasting and the performing arts suffered deep cutbacks after 1985, however, when Soviet subsidies diminished and then ceased entirely. The Tajik National Library, constructed to look like an open book, demonstrates the pride Tajiks place in their literary heritage. Housing about six million items and providing about 484,000 square feet (45,000 square metres) of space, it is the largest library in Central Asia. It overlooks the magnificent Rdak Park, at the opposite end of which sits the National Museum of Tajikistan, featuring both historical and archaeological exhibits. Sports and recreation National sports, with centuries of rich cultural underpinnings, include gushtingiri (traditional Tajik wrestling) and chavgonbozi (a form of polo). Another popular traditional sport is buzkasha sport similar to polo that involves seizing and retaining control of a goat carcass instead of hitting a ball. Dilshod Nazarov won the countrys first Olympic gold medal after competing in the mens hammer throw in the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games.Aleksandr Ilyich Imshenetsky Edward Allworth The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica  History Early history and Islamic period The Tajiks are the direct descendants of the Iranian peoples whose continuous presence in Central Asia and northern Afghanistan is attested from the middle of the 1st millennium bce. The ancestors of the Tajiks constituted the core of the ancient population of Khwrezm (Khorezm) and Bactria, which formed part of Transoxania (Sogdiana). They were included in the empires of Persia and Alexander the Great, and they intermingled with such later invaders as the Kushns and Hepthalites in the 1st6th centuries ce. Over the course of time, the eastern Iranian dialect that was used by the ancient Tajiks eventually gave way to Farsi, a western dialect spoken in Iran and Afghanistan. The Arab conquest of Central Asia that began in the mid-7th century brought Islam to the region. But tribal feuds weakened the Arabs, and, with the rise of the Smnids (819999), the Tajiks came under the rule of an Iranian dynasty. The first Turkic invaders (from the northeast) seized this area of Transoxania in 999, and, because both conquered and conquerors were Muslim, in time many Tajiksespecially those in the valleys of the Syr Darya and Amu Daryabecame Turkicized. This resulted in the transformation of a formerly purely Iranian land into Turkistan. The name Tajik, originally given to the Arabs by the local population, came to be applied by Turkic invaders and overlords to those elements of the sedentary population that continued to speak Iranian languages. Until the mid-18th century the Tajiks were part of the emirate of Bukhara, but then the Afghans conquered lands south and southwest of the Amu Darya with their Tajik population, including the city of Balkh, an ancient Tajik cultural centre. Russian imperialism and the Soviet era Russian conquests in Central Asia in the 1860s and 70s brought a number of Tajiks in the Zeravshan and Fergana valleys under the direct government of Russia, while the emirate of Bukhara in effect became a Russian protectorate in 1868. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, a considerable proportion of the Tajik people was included in the Turkestan A.S.S.R. established in April 1918. In August 1920 the Revolution was extended to the khanate of Bukhara, which embraced most of the territory occupied by modern Tajikistan; the Bukharan Peoples Soviet Republic was declared in October 1920, and early in 1921 the Soviet army captured Dushanbe and Klob (Kulyab). Tajikistan was the scene of the Basmachi revolt in 192223, and rebel bands under Ibrahim Bek operated in eastern Bukhara until 1931. The Tajik A.S.S.R. was created as part of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (S.S.R.) in 1925; in January 1925 a Special Pamirs region was created out of the Kyrgyz and Tajik parts of the Pamirs, and in December 1925 this region was renamed the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region. In 1929 the status of the Tajik A.S.S.R. was raised to that of a Soviet socialist republic. The change in status marked the first time that the Tajik people had their own state, albeit not a fully independent one, as it was still part of the Soviet Union. As a full-fledged member of the Soviet Union, the underdeveloped, mountainous Tajik S.S.R. underwent a spectacular social and economic transformation. A sense of nationhood was instilled in the Tajik peopleparticularly by B.G. Gafurov, the leader of Tajikistans Communist Party from 1946 to 1956 and a historian respected in the West. Dams were constructed for electric power generation and irrigation, and industry was developed in the Vakhsh River valley. Soviet health care and education were gradually introduced in the republic. The village of Dushanbe (known as Stalinabad from 1929 to 1961) was transformed into a modern capital city boasting the Tajik State University (1951) and the Tajik Academy of Sciences (1948). Such progress notwithstanding, Tajikistan remained the poorest republic of the Soviet Union. "},{"CountryName":"Tanzania","CulturalInfo":" Local government For administrative purposes, mainland Tanzania is divided into regions. Each region is administered by a commissioner who is appointed by the central government. At district, division, and ward levels, there are popularly elected councils with appointed executive officers. Deborah Fahy Bryceson The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica   Justice Tanzanias judiciary is appointed by the president in consultation with the chief justice. A network of primary and district courts has been established throughout the country; right of appeal for the district courts is to the high court. English, Islamic, and customary laws have been absorbed into the legal system. In Zanzibar the highest judicial authority is the Supreme Council. Muslim courts deal with marriage, divorce, and inheritance.   Political process By law Tanzania was a one-party state until 1992, when the constitution was amended to establish a multiparty political process. In 1977 the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), which had led the colony to independence, and the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP) of Zanzibar, which had taken power after a coup in 1964, merged to form the Revolutionary Party (Chama cha Mapinduzi; CCM), and a new constitution was adopted the same year. Prior to the 1992 amendment, the CCM dominated all aspects of political life, and there was no clear separation of party and government personnel at regional and district levels. In 1995 Tanzania conducted its first multiparty general elections in more than 30 years for the office of president and for members of the parliament. Although more than a dozen opposition political movements were officially registered and participated in the elections, the CCM continued to control the Union government; its involvement in local government and other local affairs, however, began to wane, particularly its administration of the 10-cell neighbourhood watch program (with each cell varying in size from single-family homes to large apartment buildings). Individuals are eligible to vote at 18 years of age, and suffrage is universal. The attainment of independence brought with it significant changes of attitudes toward women. TANUand later the Tanzanian governmentwas concerned with human welfare and an improved status for all age groups and both sexes, as expressed in its policies guaranteeing equal rights and educational opportunities. Women were encouraged to participate in political activities, and as a result, several cabinet members are women, while others hold senior positions in government and the private sector. Women who played prominent roles in early nationalist activities include Bibi Titi Mohamed and Lucy Lameck. Frank Matthew Chiteji   Health and welfare National and local governments support a network of village dispensaries and rural health centres; hospitals are located in the urban areas. Private doctors and religious organizations provide medical facilities as well. The emphasis of national health policy has been on preventive medicine, including better nutrition, maternal and child health, environmental sanitation, and prevention and control of communicable diseasesespecially HIV/AIDS, which in Tanzania was first reported in 1983 and became a serious problem in the 1990s. Although HIV/AIDS is more prevalent in major cities and towns, it has spread to villages and rural areas, especially those close to cities or on connecting roads and in border towns. In response, the Tanzanian government has instituted aggressive health campaigns to educate the public, distribute or encourage the use of condoms, safeguard blood supplies, and discourage risky sexual activity; these factors have likely contributed to the decline of the HIV prevalence rate in the 2000s. Apart from HIV/AIDS, the main communicable diseases are poliomyelitis, leprosy, tuberculosis, dysentery, and enteric fevers. Other health concerns include environmental diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, schistosomiasis, and onchocerciasis (river blindness). Inadequate nutrition, particularly of children, is a major concern. Improvements in health and reduction of mortality rates have resulted from the provision of medical care to the rural population and from an inoculation program for children. Frank Matthew Chiteji   Education The government-supported education system has three levels: primary (seven years), secondary (four to six years), and university, as well as vocational training schools. During the mid-1970s, universal primary education was made mandatory, which resulted in a vast increase in primary-school children. Popular pressure for the expansion of secondary schools has outstripped the availability of government finance. As a result, private secondary schools sponsored by religious institutions and, most notably, by parents themselves have expanded in number. Universities in Tanzania include the University of Dar es Salaam (1961), formerly part of the University of East Africa, Sokoine University of Agriculture (1984), and Zanzibar University (1998). Extensive adult education has focused on eradicating illiteracy, and, as a result, more than two-thirds of the adult population is literateabove the average for African countries but below the world average.   Cultural life  Cultural milieu Tanzania: Olduvai GorgeRock formation at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. (more)Olduvai Gorge, in the Great Rift Valley, is the site of the discovery of some of the earliest known remains of human ancestry, dating back 1.75 million years. The ancient in-migration of Cushitic, Nilotic, and Bantu peoples, displacing the native San-type population, resulted in a complex agglomeration of communities practicing complementary forms of pastoral and agricultural livelihoods. Portuguese, Arab, Indian, German, and British traders and colonists later added to the mosaic. Today Tanzanias multiethnic and multiracial population practices a variety of traditions and customs that form a rich cultural heritage. A number of unique features located throughout the country have been recognized as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their cultural and natural value; among these are the rock-painting sites at Kondoa, the ruins of the ancient ports of Kilwa Kisiwani and Songo Mnara, and Stone Town in Zanzibar.   Daily life and social customs The role of kin is central to Tanzanian social and recreational life. Visiting kin on joyous and sorrowful family occasions is given high priority despite the inconvenience caused by a relatively undeveloped transport system. Educated members of the extended family are frequently held responsible for the education and welfare of younger siblings.  "},{"CountryName":"Thailand","CulturalInfo":"Housing of ThailandMost Thai living outside of the Greater Bangkok Metropolitan Area occupy houses that their families own. The rapid growth of the Thai economy since the mid-1980s, the emergence of a prosperous middle class seeking better housing, and the lowering of mortgage interest rates spurred private-sector developers to construct new housing in urban areas. Beginning with low-cost row houses and town houses, developers gradually shifted to moderately priced condominiums aimed at middle-class urban families and luxury condominiums for the wealthy. Increasingly, middle-class urban Thai have chosen to live in condominiums while they save money to purchase single-family homes in the suburbs. Many villagers, using earnings from working in Thailands cities or abroad, in turn have built new houses based on urban and suburban models. The older style of Thai house, constructed from a combination of hardwood and bamboo materials and set on piles, is rapidly disappearing. Education Compulsory education was instituted in the 1920s for the purpose of ensuring that all citizensfemale as well as malewould share the national language and identify with the national heritage. Prior to that time, education had consisted primarily of males being taught by monks at Buddhist temples. By the late 1930s almost all children of school age in the country attended schools established by the government, although few went beyond the four years of basic primary education. Those who did attend secular secondary and tertiary institutions, monastic schools, or military and police academies typically entered government service after completing their schooling. The linking of government-sponsored education to economic development goals in the 1960s precipitated a radical transformation in Thailands educational system in the last decades of the 20th century. By the early 21st century, education had been made compulsory for nine years or until a person reached the age of 16, and three years of high school were provided by the government. Since 2004 two years of preschool have also been provided free of charge. Perhaps the most-dramatic changes have taken place in higher education. Universities have proliferated from the first one founded in Bangkok in 1917 (Chulalongkorn University) to dozens of state and private institutions spread across the country. There are also numerous teachers colleges, as well as open universities, military and police academies, and universities for monks that offer bachelors degrees. Some postsecondary students who do not attend university obtain further education in business and technical schools. Compared to other countries in the region, Thailand has one of the highest literacy rates: nearly universal for both men and women.Cultural life Observe as Thailand celebrates Loy Krathong - the traditional festival of lightsWatch the people of Thailand celebrate the festival of Loy Krathong.(more)See all videos for this articlePrior to the modernizing reforms begun in the late 19th century under King Chulalongkorn, Thai cultural life revolved around the Siamese royal court and the wat, the Buddhist temple-monastery. Many ancient practices associated with the court and the wat have been transformed into elements of contemporary Thailands national heritage. The monarchy, through its participation in royal functions, state ceremonies, and popular festivals, plays an important role in nurturing and preserving this heritage. Many state functions, today often shown on television, begin with the king or other members of the royal family performing Buddhist rites. Certain Buddhist holy days have been recognized as national holidays. Among these are Visakha Puja, the festival celebrating the birth, enlightenment, and death of the Buddha, and the beginning and end of Buddhist Lent (phansa)a three-month period corresponding to the monsoon season, during which both monks and laypeople give added attention to religious practices such as meditation. The transformation of Thai cultural life is particularly evident in clothing. In the late 19th century, members of the Thai court began to adopt Western-style clothing and for a few years in the late 1930s and early 40s such clothing was mandatory. In the post-World War II period there was a significant revival of traditional styles of clothing, especially for women. The queen adopted the tie-dye silk tubular skirt traditionally worn by Lao women in the northeast, and she was widely emulated by middle- and upper-class women when they attended events at which national culture was expected to be on display. For everyday attire in both the cities and the villages, however, most people wear clothing of a style that is considered cosmopolitan (sakon), but which, in fact, derives from Western styles. For all its Western influences, however, contemporary Thai culture is a creative blend that remains clearly rooted in Thai tradition. "},{"CountryName":"The-Bahamas","CulturalInfo":"Government and society Constitutional framework Nassau, BahamasChristopher Columbus monument at Government House, Nassau, Bahamas.(more)The constitution of The Bahamas, adopted upon independence in 1973, is patterned on the Westminster modeli.e., that of the United Kingdom. The bicameral parliament comprises the House of Assembly and the Senate, whose powers are relatively restricted compared with those of the House. The formal head of state is the British monarch, who is represented by a governor-general. The head of government is the prime minister, who is formally appointed by the governor-general. The prime minister must be a member of the House of Assembly and must be able to command a majority of its votes. House members are elected by universal adult suffrage; the members of the Senate are appointed by the governor. The term of parliament is five years, but elections may be held sooner if the prime minister is unable to retain a majority in the House or dissolves the House and calls early elections. Judicial power on the islands resides in the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court, and magistrates courts, with the ultimate court of appeal being the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom. Political process All Bahamian citizens 18 years of age and older can vote. Bahamians, women in particular, generally remained unpoliticized until the early 1950s. Women did not obtain the franchise until 1962. Great changes also came with increased educational opportunities after the 1960s. The first female member of parliament was elected in 1982. Since that time there have been female cabinet ministers, legislators, and Supreme Court justices. The main political parties are the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP; founded 1953), which led the movement for government by the majority in the 1950s and 60s, and the Free National Movement (FNM; 1972), which grew out of the PLP. Education Schooling is compulsory from age 5 to 16 and is free in government schools. Most schools are government-run, but there are also private and denominational institutions. More than nine-tenths of the population is literate. The College of The Bahamas, established in 1974 in Nassau, offers associate and bachelors degrees in most areas and masters degrees in a limited number of subjects. It also offers programs in conjunction with other universities, including the University of the West Indies, Florida International University, and the University of Miami. Other higher-level institutions include a hotel training school sponsored by the government and the hotel industry and the Bahamas Law School of the University of the West Indies. Health and welfare Bahamians are relatively free of malnutrition and debilitating diseases, and medical problems among children are largely those involving common infections. Increasing alcohol and drug abuse, obesity, and HIV/AIDS have become concerns, and care for the aged is a mounting problem. Life expectancy increased greatly in the second half of the 20th century and is comparable to that of neighbouring Caribbean countries. The Ministry of Health and Social Development administers public health services through community clinics throughout The Bahamas and offers home and district nursing and disease surveillance. There are several public hospitals in Nassau and Freeport, and there are rural health clinics on Grand Bahama and its surrounding cays. Privately operated hospitals are located in Nassau and Freeport. The Department of Environmental Health Services oversees the management, control, and conservation of the environment. Although the success of the tourism and financial sectors brought about improvements in everyday economic conditions for many Bahamians, there is still an extremely uneven distribution of wealth. The situation is not helped by the fact that the poorest and least educated have the largest families and live in the most crowded and economically depressed areas. This trend very often leads to social problems, such as increases in crime and family disruption. The government has tried to address this problem by sponsoring extensive housing developments. Cultural life Bahamian culture is an amalgam of its African and European heritages. It has also been influenced by the peoples of the Caribbean and the Americas. Daily life and social customs Family life is important to most Bahamians; however, the incidence of formal marriages decreased throughout the late 20th century. An increasing number of households are headed by a single woman, usually the mother. Before the 1940s, traditionally, women tended to be stay-at-home mothers and wives. Now, as a result of increased educational opportunities and the development of the tourist industry, most women work outside the home. Moreover, by the late 20th century, Bahamian women had begun attaining top positions in public service, banking, law, medicine, politics, and other professions. Middle- and upper-class Bahamian families usually employ a maid or domestic helper. Poorer families share the housework. Staple foods include grits, potatoes, bread, conch, fish, spiny lobster, chicken, and imported meats. National dishes are peas and rice, potato salad, macaroni and cheese, cracked conch, conch salad, fried and steamed fish, and fried chicken. Guava duff, a boiled mixture of fruit and dough that is served with a butter sauce, is a popular dessert. Folk customs include the asue (a collective savings association), friendly societies and lodges, a strong tradition of storytelling, and the use of bush medicine. Outstanding among traditional group activities is the premier festival and celebration, Junkanoo. Junkanoo parades, or rush outs, are held annually on Boxing Day and New Years Day in Nassau and on some of the Out Islands. Nassaus Bay Street is the site of the largest parade, which features thousands of junkanoos, men dressed in colourful costumes fringed with crepe paper and decorated with beads, feathers, and sequins. Participants create the music and dance to the pulsating rhythms of goatskin drums, cowbells, whistles, horns, and brass instruments. Prizes are given for the best costumes, music, dance, and theme portrayal. The arts Bahamian folklore includes stories of a three-toed, human-faced creature called the chickcharney, the workings of obia (obeah)a folk religion that employs witchcraftand folktales featuring the characters of BBooky, BRabbit, and BAnansi (see trickster tale). Religious songs or spirituals are sung at important social gatherings and wakes; these include wake, or setting up, songs with biblical themes. Rhyming songs (spiritual and secular) are also popular. Traditional ring dances and quadrilles are still practiced, and dancing to the beat of goombay (sometimes also known as rake and scrape), calypso, or soca (a blend of traditional calypso and Indian rhythmic instruments) music is a popular pastime. Cultural institutions The arts, including painting, sculpture, and photography, as well as crafts, have blossomed in The Bahamas, and the country has several prominent institutions devoted to their cultivation. The Dundas Centre for the Performing Arts, in Nassau, presents dramas, musicals, and dance performances. Art and crafts can be seen at a variety of galleries, including the National Art Gallery, located in a mansion overlooking Nassau Harbour. The Department of Archives preserves public and private records and makes them accessible to the public. The Antiquities, Monuments and Museums Corporation regulates and controls antiquities, monuments, museums, and archaeology. The Bahamas Historical Society, in Nassau, operates a museum and publishes a scholarly journal. Sports and recreation The Bahamas is famed for its long sandy beaches, clear waters, and spectacular coral reefs. Divers flock to the islands not only to view the colourful coral gardens, sharks, rays, moray eels, and other abundant marine life but also to explore the numerous shipwrecksa legacy of the tricky shallow waters and of the marauding pirates who once cruised the region. Snorkeling, windsurfing, deep-sea fishing, and sailing are also popular water sports, and almost every inhabited island hosts a sailing regatta or fishing tournament each year. For those who prefer less-strenuous water activities, the islands offer stretches of beautiful deserted beaches and gentle reef-protected waters. The Bahamas National Trust is concerned with the preservation of wildlife and the conservation of some two dozen national parks, including Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park (established 1959). Many Bahamians play and follow cricket and football (soccer), as might be expected from the islands historical association with Britain. Basketball is growing in popularity. Bahamians also have excelled at athletics (track and field), tennis, and yachting. The Bahamas Olympic Association was formed in 1952.History On October 12, 1492, Christopher Columbus, on his first voyage to the New World, made landfall somewhere in the Bahama Islands. It is widely held that he first landed on an island called by its native inhabitants Guanahani, which Columbus renamed San Salvador. The actual location is still in dispute; some scholars believe it is the place known today as San Salvador (sometimes called Watling Island), while others claim that the site was Samana Cay or Cat Island. Whatever the case, Columbus explored the island and others nearby and then sailed to Cuba and Hispaniola. The natives of the Bahama Islands, Lucayan Tainos who had settled the archipelago from Hispaniola by 800 ce, were a peaceful people who spoke an Arawakan language. Although Columbus took formal possession of the islands with pomp and ceremony in the name of Spain, and under the Treaty of Tordesillas between Spain and Portugal in 1494 the islands were within the Spanish sphere, the Spanish made little attempt to settle them. Between 1492 and 1508, Spanish raiders carried off about 40,000 natives to work in the mines of Hispaniola, and the islands remained depopulated for more than a century before the first English settlement was established. "},{"CountryName":"The-Gambia","CulturalInfo":" Government and society  Constitutional framework The Gambia is a multiparty republic. Under the constitution that was ratified 1996 and went into effect in 1997, the president, who is the head of state and government, is elected by universal suffrage to a five-year term. The president appoints the vice president and cabinet members. Legislative power is held by the National Assembly, comprising 53 members who serve five-year terms. The majority of members are elected, while five are appointed by the president.   Local government The Gambia is organized into Local Government Areas (LGA), each of which either is coterminous with a long-standing administrative unit known as a division or corresponds with roughly half of a division. The city of Banjul and the Kanifing Municipality each form a separate LGA. Most decision making is done at the village level by traditional leaders and councils of elders. Only serious or contentious matters are referred to district or government bodies.   Justice An independent judiciary is guaranteed under the constitution. The highest judicial body is the Supreme Court. Other venues include the Court of Appeal, the High Court, and the Special Criminal Court, and there are Magistrate Courts and tribunals at lower levels. The Gambias judicial system also provides for the implementation of Sharah (Islamic law) in the venue known as the Cadi Court; this court can be used by the Muslim community to resolve such issues as marriage, divorce, and matters affecting dependents.   Political process The Peoples Progressive Party (PPP), which had been the dominant political party since independence, fell from power after the 1994 coup. Since 1996 the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction has been the dominant party. In addition to the PPP, which remains active, other opposition parties include the Gambia Peoples Party, the National Democratic Action Movement, the Peoples Democratic Organization for Independence and Socialism, and the United Democratic Party.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tBritannica Quiz\t\tCountries  Their Features\t\n The constitution provides for universal suffrage for citizens 18 years and older. Although women have held legislative seats and cabinet positions, their numbers have been few.   Security The Gambian National Army is relatively small. The army has a limited marine unit and an air wing. Service is voluntary, although the constitution provides for the option of conscription. The Gambias military forces have participated in various international peacekeeping missions, including serving as United Nations Peacekeeping Forces in several countries.   Health and welfare Although improvement has been made since independence, the overall health conditions in The Gambia are poor. Inadequate sanitation is a problem for more than half of the population, and about one-third of the people do not have access to safe drinking water. Malaria poses the most significant health threat; other parasitic diseases and tuberculosis are also common health problems. The Gambia has a lower prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS than many other African countries, although it appeared to be increasing among younger women during the 2000s. Many health-care facilitiesgeneral hospitals, health centres, dispensaries, and maternity and child-care clinicstend to be centred around Banjul, but there are other hospitals and numerous clinics throughout the country. The Medical Research Council at Fajara investigates tropical diseases. Traditional healers are commonly consulted, especially in rural areas. A long-standing shortage of health-care workers in The Gambia adversely affects the staffing of medical facilities, particularly in rural areas. To address this problem, in 1999 the government established a medical school in the country to train its own doctors.   Housing Examples of colonial residential architecture can be found in Banjul, but most dwellings are single-story and are made of wood. Family compounds tend to be spread out over a large area with an inner courtyard. Outside the city centre sprawling shantytowns have been growing rapidly as more people migrate to the capital from the interior. In upcountry towns, concrete buildings of one or two stories with tin roofs predominate. Villages consist mostly of round mud huts with thatched roofs, with a few single-story concrete buildings with tin roofs. Housing supply has not been able to keep pace with The Gambias population growth. As a result, overcrowding and congestion occur in both rural and urban areas, particularly in the latter, and these conditions contributed to the growth of slums at the end of the 20th century.   Education Education at the primary level is free but not compulsory. There are secondary and postsecondary schools, including a teacher-training college at Brikama. The government established the countrys first university, the University of The Gambia, in 1999. Prior to that, Gambian students seeking higher education had to leave the country, many of them traveling to Sierra Leone, Ghana, Britain, or the United States.   Cultural life  Daily life and social customs koraA Gambian kora.(more)The Gambia has long been home to several different ethnic groups who have maintained their individual cultural traditions; as such, the country has a rich heritage. In the past, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, leatherworkers, weavers, textile dyers, and other artisans were found in all of the regions societies. Weavers and textile dyers still make distinctive cloth throughout the country; The Gambia is noted for its indigo-dyed cloth in particular. Some drum and kora (a complex stringed instrument) makers are still active, and recordings have been made of their traditional music. Gambian cuisine is nearly identical to Senegalese cooking. Staples include millet, rice, yams, plantains, and cassava (manioc). Fish, both dried and fresh, as well as sauces made from fish and peanuts dominate the diet throughout the country. Millet and rice porridges are often served as breakfast.

A new constitution in 1992, since amended, established the president as head of state and a directly elected multiparty National Assembly, members of which serve six-year terms, with a limit of two terms. The president, who is elected by direct universal suffrage for a term of five years, appoints the prime minister from the parliament majority. In 2002 a two-term limit on the presidency was abolished, but it was reinstated in 2019; it was not, however, retroactive. Local government The country is divided into five rgionsMaritime, Plateaux, Centrale, Kara, and Savanesfor the purposes of economic planning. The five rgions are subdivided into prfectures, each of which is headed by a district chief assisted by a district council. Justice The local administrative apparatus is complemented by traditional authorities, which include traditional ethnic kings or chiefs, village chiefs, and heads of family groups. These traditional authorities play a role in the judicial system, dealing with certain questions of customary law. The judicial system is headed by a Supreme Court and consists of a number of law courts in which civil, commercial, administrative, and criminal cases are heard. Political process Suffrage is universal. Various ethnic groups participate in the government, and political parties often have distinct ethnic affiliations. Women hold some senior government positions and seats in the National Assembly, though they are not widely represented. Togo had been ruled since 1969 by the Rally of the Togolese People (Rassemblement du Peuple Togolais; RPT), which was the sole political party until 1991, when other parties were legalized; it remained the ruling party until it was dissolved in 2012. Much of the RPT was reconstituted as the Union for the Republic (Union pour la Rpublique; UNIR), which became the new ruling party. Numerous political parties have been formed since they were legalized. Important among these are the Union of Forces of Change (Union des Forces du Changement; UFC), the National Alliance for Change (Alliance Nationale pour le Changement; ANC), and the Action Committee for Renewal (Comit dAction pour le Renouveau; CAR).\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \tBritannica Quiz\t\tGeography Fun Facts\t\n Security The Togolese armed forces are composed of ground forces, a navy, an air force, and a gendarmerie.

Housing Togo: mud and straw buildingMud and straw building, Koutammakou region, Togo.(more)In urban areas such as Lom, the traditional housing unit is a big walled compound composed of a group of isolated rooms, each opening onto a courtyard. Rural housing differs throughout the country. A common sight along the coast is the rectangular houses built either of clay and timber or of coconut or palm branches and topped by double-eaved thatched roofs. Scattered throughout the coconut plantations, they are not far from the beaches. Inland in the south, thatched rectangular huts made of adobe are clustered around big trees and surrounded by earthen walls or fences made of palm branches. In the north, the traditional adobe or stone huts are circular and are topped by conical roofs or thatched turrets. They are usually gathered in units corresponding to family groups; often enclosed by earthen walls, they are sometimes interlinked. The houses of the Koutammakou region in the northeast, inhabited by the Batammariba, are one such example; they have been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage site for their cultural value. Distinctive of the northern Kara region is the high density of villages that stretch along the highway or climb up the slopes of the many hills. Education Education is modeled after the French system. Primary education, which begins at six years of age and lasts for six years, is technically compulsory. Secondary education begins at 12 years of age and is made up of two cycles of four and three years, respectively. Both primary and secondary education are provided by public or parochial schools. The University of Lom (founded in 1970) provides French-language instruction and has schools of humanities and science and a university institute of technology. The University of Kara (founded in 1974) offers instruction in a range of faculties, including arts and humanities and law and politics. A school of architecture and town planning, also at Lom, was founded in 1975 by the African and Mauritian Common Organization.Cultural life Like other African peoples, the Togolese have a strong oral tradition. Little has been done, however, to promote vernacular literature. Before independence there were a few Togolese writers using French. Since independence, regional (especially Ewe) literature emerged with the works of several novelists and playwrights. Founded in 1967, the African Ballet of Togo has aimed at popularizing the finest traditional dances. The countrys national archives and national library are centred in Lom, as is the Palais de Lom, the former residence of colonial-era rulers that now is home to a contemporary art museum and a botanical park. Holidays observed in Togo include those celebrated by the Christian population, such as Easter, Assumption, Whitmonday, All Saints Day, and Christmas. The countrys Muslim community observes d al-Fir, which marks the end of Ramadan, and d al-A, which marks the culmination of the hajj rites. Other holidays include Liberation Day (January 13), which commemorates the anniversary of the coup of 1967; Independence Day (April 27); and the anniversary of the failed attack by dissidents on Lom in 1986, observed on September 23. Sports and recreation Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Togo, and the country has enjoyed international success. Togolese also enjoy boxing. In the late 1990s super middleweight Zafrou Balloqou was ranked in the worlds top 10, and Yacoubou Moutakilou and Abdoukerin Hamidou also have found success in the ring. The country competes internationally in tennis and in African Traditional Wrestling as well. Standout tennis players include Komi and Grard Loglo, who represented the country at the 1999 Davis Cup. Togo has largely been represented only by men in international sporting events, and in 1998 a seminar was held on the promotion of women in Togolese sports. In 1963 Togo founded an Olympic committee, which was recognized by the International Olympic Committee two years later. The country made its Olympic debut at the 1972 Munich Games. The country claimed its first Olympic medal at the 2008 Beijing Games when Benjamin Boukpeti placed third in the mens kayak event. Media and publishing Although the constitution provides for freedom of speech, in practice that right is restricted, and journalists often exercise self-censorship. Radio is a popular media format, particularly in rural areas. In addition to state-controlled stations, a variety of private stations are in operation, with broadcasts in English, French, and a number of local languages. Television broadcasts are limited and are mainly state-controlled. Notable publications include Togo-Presse, the state publication, and a variety of pro-opposition weeklies, including Carrefour, Le Combat du Peuple, Le Crocodile, Motion dInformation, and Le Regard, all of which were founded in the 1990s.Macaire K.

Squash, coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans constitute the main cash crops, and other important crops include yams, taro, cassava, corn (maize), watermelons, pineapples, breadfruit, limes, and tomatoes. All land is essentially owned by the Tongan monarchy, but large estates have been divided among the countrys nobles. Land is parceled out to peasant proprietors: traditionally, every male age 16 or over was entitled to an allotment of 7.5 acres (3 hectares) of land for cultivation; more recently, population growth has reduced the size of actual allotments in many places. Timber production, livestock raising, and fishing also contribute to Tongas economy. Many of Tongas products are consumed domestically, but importsmainly from New Zealand, Singapore, the United States, Fiji, and Australiaform the bulk of the goods consumed in the country. Food and beverages account for the largest category of imports, in terms of value. Exports include mainly agricultural crops and fish, and New Zealand, Japan, Australia, and the United States are the chief destinations.

A small mining industry quarries coral and sand. Crop processing and marketing have been undertaken by cooperative societies. Remittances from Tongans working overseasespecially in New Zealand, the United States, and Australiaand tourism have both contributed significantly to the growth of the Tongan economy. About one-fourth of Tongas road network consists of paved all-weather roads, almost all of which are located on the two largest islands; the remaining roads are of dirt or coral. Tonga has no railroad. Nukualofa and Neiafu are ports used for external shipping. Copra and bananas are exported from Pangai. Regular international air service to New Zealand, Fiji, Australia, Samoa, American Samoa, Niue, and Hawaii (Honolulu) is available from Fuaamotu International Airport on Tongatapu. Domestic flights are serviced by airports on Eua, Haapai, Vavau, Niuafoou, and Niuatoputapu. An undersea fibre-optic cable linking Tonga with a Fiji-based regional telecommunications network provides high-speed Internet access.   Government and society Tonga: Royal PalaceRoyal Palace, Nukualofa, Tonga.(more)Tongas constitution, granted in 1875 by King George Tupou I and amended only slightly since, established a constitutional monarchy. The chief executive is the monarch, who governs in close consultation with the prime minister in all matters except the judiciary; the monarch alone holds the power to appoint judges, grant clemency, and commute prison sentences. The monarch appoints a Privy Council, which consists of the monarch and the cabinet. The cabinet has a prime minister, a deputy prime minister, other ministers, and the governors of Haapai and Vavau. The unicameral Legislative Assembly (Fale Alea) has 26 seats: 9 hereditary nobles are elected by their peers, and 17 representatives are directly elected for three-year terms by all citizens age 21 and over. Local government is provided by three island councils: one covering Eua, the Niuas, and Tongatapu, one for the Vavau Group, and one for the Haapai Group. The Privy Council acts as part of the court system as well as assisting the monarch in an advisory capacity; it hears appeals from the land court. The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction over civil and criminal appeals from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court hears cases on matters arising under the constitution and laws of the kingdom, except for cases concerning titles to land. There are also magistrates courts and a land court. Judges are appointed by the monarch with the consent of the Privy Council and serve indefinite terms unless removed for cause. Education is free for all Tongans, and attendance is compulsory between ages 5 and 14. The government runs primary, secondary, and vocational training schools, including a teacher-training college, and the government and many Commonwealth countries offer scholarships to help Tongans pursue higher education abroad. Some primary and secondary schools as well as vocational institutions are run by churches. The University of the South Pacific operates an extension centre in Nukualofa. The private Atenisi Institute (1975) offers secondary, undergraduate, and graduate studies in the liberal arts. Tongans receive free dental and medical treatment. Although the general health of the population is adequate, rates of noncommunicable diseases related to obesity (such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease) have risen steadily since the 1970s. Family planning aids are disseminated with the help of the United Nations and New Zealand.   Cultural life Tonga: traditional handicraftsTongan women making baskets, Tongatapu Island, Tonga.(more)Although Western influence has somewhat altered traditions and culture in Tonga, certain Tongan rituals and art forms survive. For example, Tonga shares with Fiji, Samoa, and parts of French Polynesia the elaborate ritual surrounding the drinking of kava. The drink, prepared from the root of a pepper plant, has the properties of a mild narcotic. Carving was traditionally done by men, but the craftsmanship was inferior to that of other Polynesians, such as the Maori of New Zealand. Carving and other traditional crafts of higher quality have been produced, however, in response to the demands of the tourist market. Women manufacture tapa cloth from bark and weave mats and baskets from several varieties of pandanus leaves.

In the popular paddle dance, called meetuupaki, dancers carry paddle-shaped boards painted or carved with abstractions of the human body. Other popular dances include the kailao, a war dance; the lakalaka and the mauluulu, dances performed by standing and seated groups, respectively, and accompanied by densely polyphonic singing; and the tauolunga, an individual dance accompanied by singing. An oral tradition persists in Tongan villages in the form of proverbs, religious epics, genealogies, poetry, fables, and myths. "},{"CountryName":"Trinidad-and-Tobago","CulturalInfo":"Resources of Trinidad and TobagoCommercial petroleum drilling began in the early 20th century on Trinidad, and oil production subsequently expanded to offshore exploration as well. Large natural gas reserves off the coasts of Trinidad and Tobago are also exploited. Although oil production has declined from its peak in the late 1970s, both oil and natural gas contribute substantially to the countrys economy. Liquefied natural gas is a major export commodity. In addition to the large quantity of natural asphalt in Pitch Lake, Trinidad also has deposits of coal, gypsum, limestone, sand and gravel, iron ore, argillite, and fluorspar. Manufacturing Trinidad and Tobago: petroleum productionOil rig off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago.(more)Oil production and refining and the production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are the major industries, but government policy has encouraged economic diversification to reduce dependence on imports and on petroleum and LNG production. Industrial plants are engaged in the manufacture of chemicals and iron and steel products and in the assembly of consumer durables, including motor vehicles and radio and television receivers. Trinidad has chemical and fertilizer plants and a steel mill. The large-scale production of liquefied natural gas began in the 1990s. The government started fostering intensive industrial development in several areas in the late 20th century, notably in the central and southern area. Services and taxation Trinidad and TobagoBeach on the island of Tobago, Trinidad and Tobago.(more)While petroleum and natural gas continue to make the most substantial contributions to the national economy, services are a growth area, especially in the tourist sector. Tourism is based particularly in Tobago and on Trinidads northwestern peninsula. The beaches and the annual Carnival celebration are tourist draws. Yachting is expanding rapidly, with several marinas and related service activities, especially in the Chaguaramas area. Income and other taxes make up about one-third of government revenues. Transportation The islands are served by a fairly well-developed network of highways and main and local roads, but there is heavy congestion in urban areas. State-owned shipping lines and airline services connect Tobago to Trinidad. Piarco International Airport in Trinidad and Crown Point International Airport in Tobago have interisland connections and links to elsewhere in the Caribbean, North and South America, and western Europe. Port of Spain is the chief commercial port; petroleum exports are handled in ports in the south, such as Point Fortin, Pointe--Pierre, and Brighton.

Quiz\t\n Government and society Constitutional framework The first constitution of independent Trinidad and Tobago, promulgated as a British Order in Council (1962), provided for a governor-general appointed by the British monarch, a cabinet, and a bicameral Parliament, consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives. Under the constitution adopted in 1976, Trinidad and Tobago is a republic. The head of state is the president, who is elected by the Parliament; the prime minister is the head of government. The president appoints the prime minister from the House of Representativesalmost always the leader of the majority party. The members of the House of Representatives are elected by universal adult suffrage every five years; the members of the Senate are appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister and the minority party leader, except for a number of independent senators appointed at the presidents sole discretion. Senators serve until the dissolution of Parliament or upon the request of the president that they vacate office. The voting age is 18. Since 1980 Tobago has had a separate House of Assembly consisting of 12 members elected by district at a primary election, four appointed councillors, and a presiding officer, who may or may not be a member of the assembly. In January 1987 Tobago was granted full internal self-government, insofar as such self-government does not conflict with the unitary state as provided by the constitution. The legislation provides for a measure of devolution of executive powers in areas such as revenue raising and collection, agriculture, industry, tourism, environmental conservation, and social services. Trinidad is divided into 14 local government authorities: 2 city councils (Port of Spain and San Fernando), 3 borough councils (Arima, Chaguanas, and Point Fortin), and 9 counties. Health and welfare Demand for housing in the urban areas is high, but construction has been hampered by population movement, high construction costs, shortage of land, and inadequate long-term financing. State provision for social security consists of noncontributory old-age pensions, noncontributory government employee pension plans provided out of public revenues, and workers compensation compulsorily paid by employers. A national health insurance program has been established. There is a network of public clinics and hospitals where treatment is free or low-cost, but concerns about the quality of the care they offer have led to a proliferation of private, fee-paying hospitals and clinics. Education Port of Spain, Trinidad and TobagoNational Academy for the Performing Arts, Port of Spain, Trinidad.(more)Education is free at the primary and secondary levels and compulsory between the ages of 6 and 12. The government offers generous tuition grants to students at higher-education institutions. A campus of the University of the West Indies, offering courses in engineering, business administration, law, medicine, social science, natural science, education, agriculture, and humanities, is located in St. Augustine, about 10 miles (16 km) east of Port of Spain. The University of Trinidad and Tobago (established 2004), with campuses throughout the islands, provides technical and professional training in the sciences, technology, education, and other fields. The Academy for the Performing Arts, the University of Trinidad and Tobagos multidisciplinary arts program, is housed in the National Academy for the Performing Arts in Port of Spain. The University of the Southern Caribbean (1927; Seventh-day Adventist) is a private degree-granting institution near St. Joseph, Trinidad. There are also technical and vocational institutes and several nonuniversity tertiary-level institutions, both public and private. Cultural life Trinidad and TobagoCostumed dancers parading during Carnival, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.(more)The islands of Trinidad and Tobago have produced writers of international stature, including Samuel Selvon, Earl Lovelace, and Nobel Prize for Literature winner V.S. Naipaul, as well as the noted cultural historian and cricket writer C.L.R. James. The islands are known for steel-band and calypso music and for the dance known as the limbo. Derived from African music and dance forms, these are important features of the annual Carnival celebration, which to many represents the ultimate creative expression of the islands. Indo-Trinidadian music and dance underwent a renaissance beginning in the 1970s and are an important part of the countrys cultural scene. Cricket and football (soccer) are the most popular sports.

Brereton"},{"CountryName":"Tunisia","CulturalInfo":" Government and society For nearly the entire period between Tunisias achievement of independence in 1956 and the Jasmine Revolution, a popular uprising that unseated Pres. Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, the Tunisian political system featured a powerful presidential regime backed by a single political party. The constitution of 1959 granted the president sweeping executive and legislative powers while placing narrow limits on the authority of the elected legislature and the judiciary. The Neo-Destour Party, led by Tunisias first president, Habib Bourguiba, remained the only legal political party until 1981. Some new political parties were permitted in 1981, permission for a multiparty system was granted in 1988, and the first multiparty elections were held in 1989. However, since the new political parties had neither the financial nor the organizational structure to mobilize serious opposition, Neo-Destourin 1988 renamed the Democratic Constitutional Rally and known by its French acronym, RCDretained a monopoly over political activity. Laws forbidding political parties based on ethnicity, religion, region, or language prevented the major opposition group, the Islamist Ennahda (Arabic: al-Nahah [the Renaissance]) Party, from being granted legal status, and many of its leaders were jailed or exiled. The exclusion of Islamists from politics came to an end in January 2011 with the downfall of the Ben Ali regime, and by late 2011 Ennahda had emerged as the strongest party in the country, winning 90 seats in the 217 member Constituent Assembly tasked with drafting a new constitution to replace the suspended 1959 text. Tensions between Islamists and secularists at times appeared to threaten Tunisias transition to democracy, but they showed a tendency to compromise and cooperate in order to ensure a stable transition. In January 2014, after more than two years of contentious negotiations, the Constituent Assembly voted overwhelmingly to approve a constitution that seemed to be acceptable to all sides. When elections later that year put neither Islamists nor secularists in a commanding position, the largest parties from either side formed a unity government. The partisanship of the parliament rendered it ineffective in passing important legislation or even appointing members to a constitutional court. Because the court remained vacant, the country was plunged into a constitutional crisis when no judicial body was able to resolve a standoff between the parliament and Pres. Kais Saied that began in January 2021. Saied suspended the constitution in September and put a new constitution to referendum in July 2022. The new constitution, which went into effect following the certification of the referendum, returned Tunisia to a presidential system whose legislative and judicial bodies were significantly limited.  Constitutional framework The constitution proclaims Tunisia a republic with Arabic as its language and Islam as its religion. It promises freedom of expression and the right to form political parties and associations, as well as freedom of religious belief. The 2022 constitution instituted a bicameral legislature. The lower house, called the Assembly of the Peoples Representatives, originates legislation, provided that bills are introduced by at least 10 members and take budgetary concerns into consideration. Its members are popularly elected to five-year terms. The upper chamber, called the National Assembly of Regions and Districts, has the power to strip immunity from legislators, but its role in the legislative process is mostly unspecified by the constitution and is determined by statute. Its members are elected by regional and district councils; the length of their terms is not constitutionally specified. Certain constitutional duties must be carried out by both houses, such as the dismissal of government by a two-thirds vote. The president is directly elected for a five-year term and may be reelected only once, although the tenure may be extended in times of imminent danger. Candidates for president must be Muslim, at least 40 years old, and Tunisian citizens by birth. As head of state, the president is the commander in chief of the armed forces and conducts foreign policy. The president appoints the prime minister and cabinet ministers, who report to the president, as well as members of the judiciary. In addition, the president has the ability to introduce legislation and constitutional amendments and to dissolve parliament.   Local government The country is divided into 24 administrative areas called wilyt (provinces; singular wilyah), each of which is headed by a wl (governor). Each province is designated by the name of its chief town and is in turn subdivided into numerous units called mutamadiyyt (delegations), whose number varies according to province size. Delegations are administered by a mutamad and are in turn divided into more than 2,000 districts called minaqah turbiyyahs. Tunisia is further divided into scores of municipalities and rural councils.   Justice Tunisias legal system is based on French civil law with some influence from a liberal interpretation of Islamic law (Sharah). The independence and neutrality of the courts are guaranteed by the constitution. The judiciary is made up of the courts of first instance, appellate courts, and the Court of Cassation. A separate system of administrative courts deals with legal disputes between individuals and state or public institutions, and cases concerning the management of public funds are handled by the Court of Audit. The Supreme Judicial Council, a body comprising judges and other legal specialists, oversees the functioning of the justice system. The Constitutional Court has the authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws and treaties. The constitution assigns nine members to the court: three appointed by the appellate courts, three by the Court of Cassation, and three by the Court of Audit.   Political process Since the Jasmine Revolution and the dissolution of the RCD in 2011, dozens of new political parties have gained formal recognition. Ennahda emerged as the strongest, and several centre-left parties also have significant support. Since independence, a prominent feature of Tunisian social policy has been the effort to improve the status and lives of women. Compared with their counterparts in other Arab countries, women in Tunisia have enjoyed greater equality before the law. The progressive Code of Personal Status, which was introduced in 1956, has been amended to affirm and enhance womens political, social, and economic roles. The constitution adopted in 2022 guarantees the equality of men and women before the law.   Security Tunisia maintains a relatively small active-duty military, consisting mostly of conscripts whose term of service is one year. The army is the largest branch (with the highest number of conscripts), but the country also has a small navy and air force. The former consists mainly of small patrol vessels. The air force has relatively few high-performance aircraft. A national police forcewhose jurisdiction is largely restricted to the citiesand a largely rural national guard report to the Ministry of the Interior and are responsible for national security.   Health and welfare The living standards of the population in general are modest. The countrys national health system provides nearly all of its population with access to medical care. Despite rising public expenditure on health, many Tunisians have been turning to private health care as demand outstrips supply. A good network of hospitals and clinics has contributed to a relatively low death rate and, in particular, to one of the lowest infant mortality rates on the African continent.   Housing El-Kef, TunisiaThe town and citadel of El-Kef (Al-Kf), northwestern Tunisia.(more)Traditional urban housing in Tunisiafound in the old city centres, or medinasconsisted of tightly arranged structures grouped within town walls and interlaced by a network of narrow walkways and passages. Building exteriors generally were whitewashed, with little decoration, while interiors were ornate and comfortable. Each neighbourhood (Arabic: rah) was restricted to a particular ethnic or religious group, and it was only with the beginning of the protectorate that these city centres began to give way to European-style city plans. Following independence, the government began to encourage the restoration of the medinas, and architects have more recently sought to mitigate Western influence in favour of traditional architectural patterns. Unique to the region are the underground dwellings found in the rural southeastern part of the country. These structures were designed for habitation in a harsh, arid environment and generally consist of a sunken central courtyard surrounded by individual family dwellings, storage areas, and workrooms, all of which are built into the earth. (Scenes from the motion picture Star Wars were filmed at such a dwelling located in the village of Matmata [Mamah].)   Education Education is free to all school-age children, and schooling is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 16. Virtually all of the countrys children are enrolled in primary education, and nearly one-sixth of its young people go on to attend one of the countrys universities or institutes of higher learning. More than three-fourths of the population is literate; the rate among men is somewhat higher than that among women, but the gap is narrowing. Kairouan, Tunisia: Sidi Sahab zwiyahCourtyard of the zwiyah (religious college) of Sidi Sahab near Kairouan (Al-Qayrawn), Tunisia.(more)Growth in the number of schools, students, and teachers has created a serious financial strain, as education has constituted one of the largest shares of the annual national budget. Students have had no alternative other than turning to private funding to supplement state education allowances, and they increasingly have been denied the choice of subject area or school. Given the difficulties of finding enough job opportunities for qualified people, more emphasis has been placed on technical, vocational, teacher, and agricultural training. The University of Tunis (founded 1960) is the countrys major institution of higher education. Several more universities have opened since the 1980s, and there are also religious schools.    Cultural life Tunisians are an independent-minded people who take pride in the rich admixture of native and foreign influences that make up their national character. Their Arab-Muslim country was deeply imbued with French culture during the 75 years of the protectorate, which ended in 1956.

The territory that now constitutes the republic has been subject to a striking range of cultural influences; these have left a rich archaeological legacy, still visible in the landscape, from the civilizations of Classical Europe and the Islamic Middle East. Several locations of cultural significance have been designated UNESCO World Heritage sites, including historic areas around Istanbul, the Great Mosque and Hospital of Divrii, the old Hittite capital of Hattusha, the remains at Nemrut Da and Xanthos-Letoon, the city of Safranbolu, and the archaeological site of Troy. In addition to these, UNESCO recognized two mixed-interest properties (sites of both cultural and natural significance) in Turkey: the area of Greme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia, which is known for the traces of Byzantine art extant amid its dramatic rocky landscape, and Hierapolis-Pamukkale, which is known for its terraced basins of unique mineral formations and petrified waterfalls, where ruins of the thermal baths and temples constructed there in the 2nd century bce are still present. Hagia SophiaThe Hagia Sophia rising along the shore of the Bosporus, Istanbul.(more)With the division of the Roman Empire into western and eastern sections, Asia Minor became part of the Byzantine realm (see Byzantine Empire), centred at Constantinople (Istanbul). The rise of Islam in the east led to a division of the peninsula between the Byzantine Christian world and the Islamic Middle East, and it was not until the arrival of the Turks that Asia Minor finally became part of the Islamic world. The Ottoman Empire was multinational and multicultural; the new Turkey established by Atatrk, however, was more homogeneous in language and religion than its predecessor states. Under Atatrk and his followers, Turkey became increasingly secular and Western-oriented, a trend manifested in the reform of the Turkish language, the replacement of the traditional Arabic script by a modified Roman alphabet, and the separation of Islam from the state. Nevertheless, Islam has exerted a profound influence on the relations between the sexes and on family life. The strength of this influence varies between the more- and less-developed regions of the country, between urban and rural populations, and between the social classes.  Daily life  Work In the rural areas each season has different tasks and activities. Except in the south and west, winter is a period of frost, snow, and social activities. Animals are often kept indoors and fed mainly chopped straw. With the spring thaw, plowing and sowing are soon under way. After a month or so of less-urgent work, the hay harvest is followed immediately by the main grain harvest, a period of intense activity lasting some six to eight weeks; everyone works, some people 16 to 20 hours a day. Most village areas contain weavers, masons, carpenters, and smiths such as tinsmiths. Some villagers go to town for craft services, and a number of craftsmen travel around the villagesparticularly specialists, such as sieve makers or sawyers. Safranbolu, Turkey: bazaarA bazaar in Safranbolu, Turkey.(more)It is impossible to summarize in a few words the material culture of the towns and cities, which not long ago were the central part of a great empire and have since been profoundly influenced by European fashions and technology. Most towns, large and small, nevertheless still contain markets where simple lockup shops stand side by side in rows. Usually these are arranged by craft or warescoppersmiths, jewelers, cobblers, tailors, motor mechanics, and so on. Retailers also are grouped by commodity. The larger towns have become increasingly Westernized, with modern factories, offices, and shops. Large-scale commuting from sprawling suburban areas is typical of the major cities, where it produces traffic congestion, air pollution, and strains on public transportation.   Dress traditional Turkish dressTurkish boys in traditional dress.(more)Turkish men have increasingly adopted the styles and sombre colours of European male dress. Fezzes and turbans were abolished by law in 1925, and most peasants now wear cloth caps. The famous Turkish baggy trousers, exceedingly full in the seat, are still quite common in rural areas and among the poorer town dwellers, but the traditional cummerbund and colourful shift or waistcoat are rare. Village women still largely preserve traditional attire. They wear some locally customary combination of baggy trousers, skirts, and aprons. In many areas it is still possible to identify a womans town or village and her marital status by her dress; village women in Turkey have never worn a veil, but they have traditionally covered their heads and mouths with a large scarf. This practice has been revived among the more devout urban women, though the scarf is often combined with Western dress.   Religious practice For the observant, Islam entails many duties. Men and women are to maintain a state of ritual purity, pray five times a day, fast during the month of Ramadan every year, and strive, if possible, to visit Mecca at least once in their lifetime. Islam provides basic ideas about the nature of morality, charity, transgression, reward and punishment, and relations between men and women, as well as about cleanliness and impurity.     Cuisine falafel sandwichEggplant, olives, and yogurt are widely eaten in Turkey and all Middle Eastern countries. Chickpeas are toasted or ground. Lamb is the staple meat throughout the region. One of the most characteristic elements of the cuisines of the Middle East is the offering of an almost unlimited array of small hot and cold appetizers. These are called mazza (Arabic), mezethakia (Greek), or mezelicuri (Romanian), and their ingredients and preparation have developed over the centuries as a result of the confluence of many cultures. baklavaBaklava, a rich dessert of phyllo dough and nuts.(more)bozaBoza or Bosa, traditional Turkish dessert with roasted chickpea.(more)The Turkish influence is still dominant in the countries of the old Ottoman Empire: Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, and other parts of the Balkan region. Vine leaves stuffed with rice and meat are popular. They are called dolma in Turkey. Brek, a turnover filled with meat or cheese, is another favourite. ikebabi (shish kebab), skewered mutton or lamb, is enjoyed in all these countries, as is kofte, a lamb patty. Yogurt dishes and a sweet known as halvah are commonly found. A favourite dessert is baklava, a rich pastry filled with nuts and layered with honey or syrup, as is the sugar-dusted jellied confection called lokum (or Turkish delight). Also popular is boza, a thick, fermented malt drink made from corn, wheat, millet, or bulgur (depending on location), with a subtle tart, tangy taste and a very low alcohol content.    Social roles and kinship  Male and female roles In rural areas the main responsibilities of the men are the heavy agricultural work, looking after the livestock, and making all contacts outside the home, both official and economic, including shopping. Womenwidows, for examplemight do mens work, but men never undertake womens tasks. One consequence of this is that men are more dependent on women than women are on men, and a bereaved widower who has no other adult women in his household may remarry within a few days or weeks. Women are concerned with the care of children and their houses and with the preparation and cooking of food. They are also responsible for milking, caring for the chickens, making cakes of winter fuel from dung and straw, weeding vegetable plots near the village, and reaping barley and other short-stemmed crops. Overall, women are responsible for a high proportion of the agricultural work in addition to their domestic duties. In urban areas the role of women is related to social class. The emancipation of women was among the Westernizing objectives of Atatrkism, and for the urban educated middle and upper classes much has been achieved. Women were given the right to vote in 1930, women were first elected to parliament in 1935, and a woman first held the prime ministership in the 1990s. Women are found in medicine, science, and the arts, and increasing numbers of women work in industry and the service sector. The position of working-class urban womenparticularly from the families of recent migrantsand of women in rural areas, however, remains highly traditional. The structure of social relationships is in innumerable ways profoundly affected by the sharp social segregation of men and women. This segregation is related to attitudes toward sex and sexuality, which are often seen as ritually impure and somewhat shameful; for example, sex is a banned topic between close kin, and a young couple is forbidden to show any interest in each other if anyone else, even a member of the household, is present.  "},{"CountryName":"Turkmenistan","CulturalInfo":"Cultural life Daily life and social customs Turkmen cuisine shares much in common with other cuisines of the region yet is markedly set apart by its nomadic tradition and geography. One of the most popular dishes is ash, a rice and meat pilaf not unlike those of other cuisines in Central Asia. Meat and dairy play a heavy role in Turkmen cuisine, particularly fatty mutton and sheeps milk. A variety of dishes involving fish are also common in the Western part of the country near the Caspian Sea. Spices are used sparingly; Turkmen cooking aims instead to preserve the ingredients flavours. Some public holidays reflect Turkmenistans cultural milieu, while others centre on national events. Like many countries in the region, Turkmenistan celebrates the spring festival of Nrz. The Islamic holidays of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are likewise observed as public holidays. A day of remembrance is held on October 6 to pay respects to the victims of the devastating 1948 earthquake in Ashgabat. The arts The widespread Turkmen traditional practice of composing poetry orally gave way, after printing became well established in Turkmen centres in the 1920s, to writing and to the dissemination of verse and prose in book form. Although written Turkmen literature dates at least to the 18th-century poet Mahtum Quli (Magtim Guli), it underwent a burst of growth when the literary publications of the new republic began to appear in the late 1920s and 30s. Outstanding graduates of Bukharan seminaries such as Abdulhekim Qulmuhammed-oghli (died c. 1937) brought about a renewal of intellectual and cultural life in Soviet Turkmenistan. Qulmuhammed-oghli served in the anti-Soviet Basmachi resistance movement, later became a communist nationalist, and influenced younger intellectuals through his activities as a writer, editor, researcher, and cultural organizer. All such efforts came to an end in the 1930s when the purges instigated by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and carried out locally by Russian and Turkmen communists destroyed this small core of outstanding intellectual leaders, including Qulmuhammed-oghli. After that, Soviet-educated intellectuals dominated cultural life. Among these figures, Berdi Kerbabayev attained some renown for his novel Aygtl dim (1940; The Decisive Step) and a later novel, Nebit-Dag (1957), as well as plays, poems, and translations. Cultural institutions Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, at nightA nighttime view of the white marble buildings that line the main avenue of Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.(more)The cultural centre of Turkmenistan is Ashgabat, which hosts several museums and monuments. The most notable of these is the National Museum of History, which features a sizable number of exhibits representing 50,000 years of Turkmenistans history. Another museum, housed in the gold-domed Palace of Knowledge, celebrates and glorifies Niyazov. The city is full of marble edifices and golden statues, most of which were erected during Niyazovs presidency. Media and publishing Media and publication are tightly controlled by the state. Nearly all television stations and newspapers in the country are state-owned. Some provisions exist for private outlets, but they must secure state licensing and provide positive coverage of the government. Literary expression is likewise controlled despite efforts to enrich Turkmen literature; for a time, in order to promote Niyazovs Rukhnama, the publication of all other works was suppressed. Perhaps the greatest shift in publication in the transition from the Soviet era to independence was the change in script used for the Turkmen language. The Turkmen-language literary publications that appeared in Soviet Turkmenistan in the late 1920s and 30s first used a modified Arabic script, then a modified Latin alphabet, and finally a modified Cyrillic alphabet. After independence Turkmen writers, religious leaders, and educators entered a debate over their alphabet; though many wished to return to the Arabic writing system, Turkmenistan adopted a modified Latin alphabet. A studio in Ashgabat produces films, and television stations transmit from the capital and from Trkmenbashy. In the decade or so following independence, most broadcasting and films employed the Russian language rather than Turkmen; the use of Russian in public platforms was severely restricted in 2005. Broadcasts in Turkmen are often translations of programs that originated in Russian and other languages.Viktor Borisovich Zhmuida Edward Allworth  History Early civilization and arrival of the Turkmens It is possible to follow the development of human habitation in southern Turkmenistan from Paleolithic times to the present. Some of the earliest traces of agriculture in Central Asia were discovered some 20 miles (32 km) north of Ashgabat in the Neolithic Jeitun civilization, which may be dated to the 5th millennium bce. The Jeitun civilization was followed by a series of other Neolithic cultures, and a cultural unification of southern Turkmenistan occurred in the Early Bronze Age (25002000 bce). During the course of the following half millennium, some urban centres were created; the ruins of Namazga-Tepe cover approximately 145 acres (60 hectares). From about the mid-3rd century bce to the Sasanian conquest in the 4th century ce, Turkmenistan formed part of the Parthian empire (see Parthia). Into this land came, probably in the 11th century, the Turkmens, strangers, as it were, with no links to any previous civilization of the region. Contemporary historians did not distinguish them from the Oghuz, a loose confederation of Turkic tribes present in the region since the 9th century. Turkmens came under the rule of the Seljuq dynasty (10381194) of Oghuz tribes, and they weathered the Mongol invasions (13th century) quite well; the southern tribes became part of the Il-Khanid empire, and the northern tribes belonged to the Golden Horde. One of the Turkmens principal occupations for centuries after the decline of Mongol rule was robbing passing caravans.

Lieutenant General Yoweri Kaguta Museveni came to power in 1986 as the leader of the National Resistance Movement (NRM). He was elected president in 1996, although he ostensibly represented no political party. The country does have many parties, however, such as the Democratic Party, the Uganda Peoples Congress, and the Forum for Democratic Change. Women played a significant role in the formulation of the 1995 constitution, and the NRM government has assisted them in a number of ways. The Ministry of Women in Development was established in 1988 to formulate and implement womens programs and especially to make the public aware of womens issues. By 1990 eight women held ministerial posts in the government, and the first woman vice president in sub-Saharan Africa, Specioza Wandira Kazibwe, was appointed in 1994. In the 2020s, women held about one-third of the seats in Parliament and about two-fifths of the cabinet positions. Security Ugandas armed forces, named the Uganda Peoples Defense Forces, consist of air force, marine, and army contingents as well as paramilitary forces. Security problems in the north of the country have kept them active, as have foreign engagements in such countries as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Border disputes with Kenya (in the 1980s) and Sudan (in the 1990s) have also occupied Ugandas military. Ugandan troops have participated in United Nations-led international peacekeeping missions and are part of the African Unions standby peacekeeping force. Health and welfare Only about half of the population has access to medical facilities, though since 1986 an internationally funded program has been under way to improve health-care infrastructure, training, and supplies. There are more than 100 hospitals; slightly more than one-half are government-operated. In addition, numerous health centres provide medical care throughout the country. Malaria, measles, anemia, acute respiratory infections and pneumonia, gastrointestinal diseases, sleeping sickness, venereal diseases, schistosomiasis, guinea worm (dracunculiasis), tuberculosis, chicken pox, and typhoid are all serious problems in Uganda. At the root of many of these diseases is a lack of clean water. AIDS, known locally as slim because of its debilitating effects, spread widely in the early 1980s and has placed stress on families and an already frail health-care infrastructure. However, there has been a vigorous campaign to educate and inform the public about AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, and in 1998 Uganda became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to report a significant decrease in the rate of HIV infection. Although HIV/AIDS persisted among Ugandas population into the first decades of the 21st century, the adult prevalence rate showed an overall decline during 19902020. Housing The government has sponsored housing development projects in urban areas such as Kampala, where there is a tremendous need to provide new housing units in order to keep up with the rising population. Rural houses are often made of mud and wattle. For the Nyoro, houses were traditionally built around a central courtyard. Ganda settlements, usually located on hillsides, can include as many as 40 to 50 homes. Education Primary education begins at six years of age and continues for seven years. Secondary education begins at 13 years of age and consists of a four-year segment followed by a two-year segment. In early 1997 Uganda revolutionized education policy by introducing an initiative called Universal Primary Education, under which the government would pay tuition fees for all orphans and for up to four children per family. The policy, aimed at rapidly expanding literacy throughout the population, resulted in an increase in school attendance. A similar program for post-primary education was initiated in early 2007. Many of the oldest schools in Uganda were established by Christian missionaries from Europe. Since independence their role has been superseded by that of the government, but, because of the limited number of secondary schools, private schools have remained an important component of Ugandas educational system. Makerere University in Kampala, which began as a technical school in 1922, was the first major institution of higher learning in East and Central Africa. In addition to its medical school, Makereres faculties include those of agriculture and forestry, arts, education, technology, law, science, social sciences, and veterinary medicine. A number of new institutions of higher learning have opened since the late 1980s, including Mbarara University of Science and Technology (1989), Uganda Christian University (founded as Bishop Tucker Theological College in 1913; present name and university status conferred in 1997), Uganda Martyrs University (1993), and Islamic University in Uganda (1988). In addition to these, there are primary-teacher training colleges, technical schools and colleges, and business colleges.Cultural life Cultural diversityfrom the Ganda culture in the south and Acholi and Lango cultures in the north to the influence of South Asians past and presenthas produced a wide variety of lifestyles and interests among Ugandans. The country possesses a rich tradition of theatre, ranging from the very active National Theatre in Kampala to hundreds of small, local theatrical groups. Theatre has played an important role in educating and informing the public on a range of issues from gender relations to sexually transmitted diseases. Another popular and widespread form of entertainment is the small video booth, many hundreds of which are spread throughout the towns and small rural trading centres. A video booth, which can operate on a vehicle battery, provides an opportunitymainly for young peopleto see a variety of films; but, more important, the booths also show occasional short informative films supplied by government agencies. Television is widely available in urban centres and in some smaller rural centres, where it is not uncommon to see a large group of people clustered in front of one set. "},{"CountryName":"Ukraine","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life  Cultural milieu Ukraine possesses a wealth of cultural talent and a considerable cultural legacy. Numerous writers have contributed to the countrys rich literary history. Impressive monuments of architecture and museums displaying works by generations of Ukrainian artists can be found throughout the country, and art galleries featuring contemporary Ukrainian artists have become commonplace in larger urban centres. The countrys strong tradition of folk art also continues to this day. In addition, high-calibre performing artists and ensembles appear regularly in Ukraines numerous theatres and concert halls. Because of the countrys geographical location, Ukrainian culture has been influenced by the cultures of both western Europe and Russia. Although these influences are particularly evident in the western and eastern halves of the country, respectively, there is no strict geographical division. For example, Russian is spoken in the streets and in many homes and institutions throughout the country; it also is used in national publications, radio broadcasts, and popular music. The countrys other ethnic minorities contribute to a measure of cultural diversity as well.   Daily life and social customs The social changes brought about by Ukrainian independence are most evident in the cities, particularly Kyiv. The countrys capital now boasts high-end stores catering to a moneyed class, and a fashionable strip of contemporary art galleries and cafs winds its way down the historical street of Andriyivskyi Uzviz. The capitals renovated airport stands in striking contrast to its decidedly dour appearance in Soviet times. The cities, with their broad sidewalks and extensive greenery, are eminently suited for walking. Ukrainians generally do a considerable amount of walking, either to get around or simply for enjoyment. Parks are plentiful and popular for strolling or picnicking, a common pastime among city dwellers, most of whom live in apartments. The cities also feature numerous kiosks, which sell all manner of wares. folk dancing in UkraineFolk dancers in traditional dress, Ukraine.(more)Cultural pursuits and entertainment are widespread. Most of Ukraines major cities have ornate theatres with their own opera or ballet companies. Song-and-dance ensembles, most notably the Verovka State Chorus and the Virsky Dance Ensemble, have made Ukrainian folk music and dance into an impressive stage art. Though classical music remains popular, contemporary Western-style music has expanded its audience considerably and now dominates the airwaves on numerous commercial radio stations. Street concerts and club performances are common, as are dance clubs and cabarets. Imported television soap operas have developed a dedicated following, and cinemas show American blockbusters. The country offers a variety of restaurants that serve Chinese, Greek, Continental, or other foreign cuisine. Pizza bars and other fast-food restaurants are increasingly common as well. Many Ukrainians, however, still prefer such traditional Ukrainian foods as borscht, cabbage rolls, varenyky (dumplings), studynets (a form of headcheese), and shashlyky (kebabs). On festive occasions these dishes are accompanied by vodka or champagne and eloquent toasts. The dish known as chicken Kiev, though commonly served in Ukraine, likely originated elsewhere. In the countryside, horse-drawn carts with rubber wheels have not quite disappeared. The khata (house), made of mud and thatch and typically whitewashed, is still found as well. These homes often contain such traditional handiwork as embroideries, weavings, and handmade feather duvets and oversized pillows. Their inhabitants are predominantly elderly Ukrainians. Ihor Stebelsky Ivan Alekseyevich Yerofeyev Andrij Makuch  "},{"CountryName":"United-Arab-Emirates","CulturalInfo":"Political process On the whole, leadership in each emirate falls to that emirates most politically prominent tribe (an agnatic lineage group composed of a number of related families), and the paramount leader, the emir, is selected by the notables of the ruling tribe from among their numberthis is usually, but not always, a son of the previous emir. Each tribe, however, has its own leader, or sheikh, and a certain degree of political pluralism is necessary to maintain the ruling familys position. This is largely facilitated by the institution called the majlis, the council meeting. During the majlis the leader hears grievances, mediates disputes, and disperses largesse, and, in theory, anyone under the leaders rule must be granted access to the majlis. There are no political parties in the emirates, and, until the beginning of the 21st century, no elections were held. An electoral college meets every four years to select half of the membership of the advisory Federal National Council; the other half is designated by appointment. Beginning with the 2019 elections, half of the council members must be women. The electoral college has expanded rapidly: it consisted of fewer than 7,000 citizens when the first election was held in 2006; by the third election in 2015 the electoral college included more than 224,000, about one-third of voting-age citizens; and by 2019 the number had expanded to 337,000 and for the first time included slightly more women than men. Security The emirates defense forces were merged in 1976, but the forces in Dubai and Abu Dhabi have retained some independence. The Supreme Council has made the right to raise armed forces a power of the national government. In 2006 the Supreme National Security Council, which included the president, prime minister, and chief of staff of the armed forces, among others, was formed to deal with the emirates security needs. The number of uniformed military personnel is high for a country the size of the emirates, as is total military spending per capita. Most personnel are in the army, but the emirates maintain a small navy and air force, and a large number of expatriates serve in the military. Health and welfare Hospital services are free to nationals, and medical services are concentrated in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, which have numerous hospitals, child welfare clinics, and other health facilities. In the late 1990s the emirates began privatizing health care, which led to a significant rise in the number of hospitals and physicians. The government subsidizes health insurance for its citizens, and thus public spending on health care has also increased alongside the increase in privatization. Housing A considerable proportion of government spending, at both the federal and local levels, is devoted to constructing and financing housing and to developing civil infrastructure such as power, water, and waste removal. The federation government makes housing available to citizens through direct low-interest loans, subsidies on rental units, and grants of housing at no charge, and thousands of Emiratis have taken advantage of these programs. Education Education in the emirates is free and mandatory at the primary and secondary levels for all children from age 6 to 18. There are a number of fine institutions of higher education in the emirates, and both boys and girls attend public school. Female students far outnumber males at the United Arab Emirates University, which opened at Al-Ain in 1977, and at the Higher Colleges of Technology system (1988) throughout the emirates. Zayed University (1998) was established to provide women with technical education, though in 2008 it began admitting men as well. Overall, women make up approximately 70 percent of university graduates at Emirati universities, although men are much more likely than women to go abroad for university study. By the 2010s the vast majority of the population was literate.Cultural life The cultural traditions of the United Arab Emirates are rooted in Islam and resonate with the wider Arab world, especially with the neighbouring states of the Persian Gulf. The federation has experienced the impact of Islamic resurgence, though the practice of Islam in the emirates is generally less austere than in Saudi Arabia. Tribal identities in the United Arab Emirates remain fairly strong, despite urbanization and the presence of a large expatriate community, and the family is still considered the strongest and most cohesive social unit. "},{"CountryName":"United-Kingdom","CulturalInfo":" Higher education Universities historically have been independent and self-governing; however, they have close links with the central government because a large proportion of their income derives from public funds. Higher education also takes place in other colleges. Students do not have a right to a place at a university; they are carefully selected by examination performance, and the dropout rate is low by international standards. Most students receive state-funded grants inversely related to their parents income to cover the tuition fees. In addition, most students receive state-funded loans to cover living expenses. Foreign students and British students taking a degree at an overseas university are not generally eligible for public funding. Public funds flow to universities through recurrent grants and in the form of tuition fees; universities also derive income from foreign students and from various private-sector sources. After a major expansion in the 1960s, the system came under pressure in the 1980s. Public funding became more restricted, and the grant system no longer supported students adequately. The government introduced the present system of student loans to replace dwindling grants for living expenses and established higher-education funding councils in each part of the United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland) to coordinate state support of higher education. In 2010, in the interest of budget reduction, the government raised the maximum level of tuition for higher educational institutions in England to 9,000 (about $11,600) per year. In 2016 that limit was raised to 9,250 (about $11,900), with plans to allow further increases to keep up with inflation.

Barr Peter  Kellner    Cultural life West End theatre district, LondonThe theatre district in the West End, London.(more)English culture tends to dominate the formal cultural life of the United Kingdom, but Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have also made important contributions, as have the cultures that British colonialism brought into contact with the homeland. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland share fully in the common culture but also preserve lively traditions that predate political union with England. Widespread changes in the United Kingdoms cultural life occurred after 1945. The most remarkable was perhaps the emergence first of Liverpool and then of London in the 1960s as a world centre of popular culture. The Beatles were only the first and best-known of the many British rock groups to win a world following. British clothing designers for a time led the world as innovators of new styles of dress for both men and women, and the brightly coloured outfits sold in Londons Carnaby Street and Kings Road shops briefly became more symbolic of Britain than the traditionally staid tailoring of Savile Row. Underlying both this development and a similar if less-remarked renewal of vigour in more traditional fields were several important social developments in the decades after World War II. Most evident was the rising standard of education. The number of pupils going on to higher education increased dramatically after World War II and was matched by a major expansion in the number of universities and other institutions of higher education. In society in general there was a marked increase in leisure. Furthermore, immigration, particularly from the West Indies and South Asia, introduced new cultural currents to the United Kingdom and contributed to innovation in music, film, literature, and other arts.  Daily life and social customs The United Kingdoms cultural traditions are reflective of the countrys heterogeneity and its central importance in world affairs over the past several centuries. Each constituent part of the United KingdomEngland, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Irelandmaintains its own unique customs, traditions, cuisine, and festivals. Moreover, as Britains empire spanned the globe, it became a focal point of immigration, especially after the independence of its colonies, from its colonial possessions. As a result, immigrants from all corners of the world have entered the United Kingdom and settled throughout the country, leaving indelible imprints on British culture. Thus, at the beginning of the 21st century, age-old English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh customs stood alongside the rich traditions of Afro-Caribbean, Asian, and Muslim immigrants, placing the United Kingdom among the worlds most cosmopolitan and diverse countries.   The arts Globe Theatre, LondonCelebratory performance marking the opening of the Globe Theatre in London, June 12, 1997.(more)From the plays of William Shakespeare to the music of the Sex Pistols, British art has had a tremendous impact on world culture. Writers from every part of the United Kingdom, joined by immigrants from parts of the former British Empire and the Commonwealth, have enriched the English language and world literature alike with their work. British studios, playwrights, directors, and actors have been remarkable pioneers of stage and screen. British comedians have brought laughter to diverse audiences and been widely imitated; British composers have found devoted listeners around the world, as have various contemporary pop groups and singer-songwriters; and British philosophers have had a tremendous influence in shaping the course of scientific and moral inquiry. From medieval time to the present, this extraordinary flowering of the arts has been encouraged at every level of society. Early royal patronage played an important role in the development of the arts in Britain, and since the mid 20th century the British government has done much to foster their growth. The independent Arts Council of Great Britain, which was founded in 1946, supported many kinds of contemporary creative and performing arts until 1994, when it devolved into the Arts Council of England (which became Arts Council England in 2003 after joining with the Regional Arts Boards), the Arts Council of Wales, and the Scottish Arts Council (the last becoming Creative Scotland 2010, when it consolidated with Scottish Screen). Having developed separately from the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland reorganized in 1995. The state-owned British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and privately owned Channel Four Television are also major patrons of the arts, especially music and film. The work of filmmakers and actors throughout the United Kingdom is supported by the Film Council, a government board that helps fund productions and secure film-related services. This support has contributed to the great expansion of the market for cultural goods and of audiences for the arts generally. As in many other highly developed countries, the clash of tastes and values between generations and, to some extent, between social classes has occasionally been sharp, as it was in the 1960s and 70s. However, the overall effect of social and financial diversity has been to make culture a major British industry.   Cultural institutions The United Kingdom contains many cultural treasures. It is home to a wide range of learned societies, including the British Academy, the Royal Geographical Society, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The British Museum in London houses historical artifacts from all parts of the globe. London is also home to many museums (e.g., the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate galleries, the Imperial War Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum) and theatres (e.g., the Royal National Theatre and those in the world-renowned West End theatre district). Cultural institutions also abound throughout the country. Among the many libraries and museums of interest in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are the Royal Museum, the Museum of Scotland, and the Writers Museum in Edinburgh, the Museum of Scottish Country Life in Glasgow, the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, and the Ulster Museum in Belfast.  "},{"CountryName":"United-States","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life The great art historian Sir Ernst Hans Josef Gombrich once wrote that there is really no such thing as art; there are only artists. This is a useful reminder to anyone studying, much less setting out to try to define, anything as big and varied as the culture of the United States. For the culture that endures in any country is made not by vast impersonal forces or by unfolding historical necessities but by uniquely talented men and women, one-of-a-kind people doing one thing at a timedoing what they can, or must. In the United States, particularly, where there is no more a truly established art than an established religionno real academies, no real official artculture is where one finds it, and many of the most gifted artists have chosen to make their art far from the parades and rallies of worldly life. Winslow Homer: DaydreamingDaydreaming, watercolours, pencil, pen, and black ink on paper by Winslow Homer, 1880 and 1882; in a private collection.(more)Some of the keenest students of the American arts have even come to dislike the word culture as a catchall for the plastic and literary arts, since it is a term borrowed from anthropology, with its implication that there is any kind of seamless unity to the things that writers and poets and painters have made. The art of some of the greatest American artists and writers, after all, has been made in deliberate seclusion and has taken as its material the interior life of the mind and heart that shapes and precedes shared national experience. It is American art before it is the culture of the United States. Even if it is true that these habits of retreat are, in turn, themselves in part traditions, and culturally shaped, it is also true that the least illuminating way to approach the poems of Emily Dickinson or the paintings of Winslow Homer, to take only two imposing instances, is as the consequence of large-scale mass sociological phenomenon. Still, many, perhaps even most, American culture makers have not only found themselves, as all Americans do, caught in the common life of their countrythey have chosen to make the common catch their common subject. Their involvement with the problems they share with their neighbours, near and far, has given their art a common shape and often a common substance. And if one quarrel has absorbed American artists and thinkers more than any other, it has been that one between the values of a mass, democratic, popular culture and those of a refined elite culture accessible only to the fewthe quarrel between low and high. From the very beginnings of American art, the top down model of all European civilization, with a fine art made for an elite class of patrons by a specialized class of artists, was in doubt, in part because many Americans did not want that kind of art, in part because, even if they wanted it, the social institutionsa court or a cathedraljust were not there to produce and welcome it. What came in its place was a commercial culture, a marketplace of the arts, which sometimes degraded art into mere commerce and at other times raised the common voice of the people to the level of high art. In the 20th century, this was, in some part, a problem that science left on the doorstep of the arts. Beginning at the turn of the century, the growth of the technology of mass communicationsthe movies, the phonograph, radio, and eventually televisioncreated a potential audience for stories and music and theatre larger than anyone could previously have dreamed that made it possible for music and drama and pictures to reach more people than had ever been possible. People in San Francisco could look at the latest pictures or hear the latest music from New York City months, or even moments, after they were made; a great performance demanded a pilgrimage no longer than the path to a corner movie theatre. High culture had come to the American living room. Mark TwainMark Twain, lithograph from Puck, 1885.(more)But, though interest in a democratic culture that could compete with traditional high culture has grown in recent times, it is hardly a new preoccupation. One has only to read such 19th-century classics as Mark Twains The Innocents Abroad (1869) to be reminded of just how long, and just how keenly, Americans have asked themselves if all the stained glass and sacred music of European culture is all it is cracked up to be, and if the tall tales and Cigar-Store Indians did not have more juice and life in them for a new people in a new land. Twains whole example, after all, was to show that American speech as it was actually spoken was closer to Homer than imported finery was. In this way, the new machines of mass reproduction and diffusion that fill modern times, from the daguerreotype to the World Wide Web, came not simply as a new or threatening force but also as the fulfillment of a standing American dream. Mass culture seemed to promise a democratic culture: a cultural life directed not to an aristocracy but to all men and women. It was not that the new machines produced new ideals but that the new machines made the old dreams seem suddenly a practical possibility. The practical appearance of this dream began in a spirit of hope. Much American art at the turn of the 20th century and through the 1920s, from the paintings of Charles Sheeler to the poetry of Hart Crane, hymned the power of the new technology and the dream of a common culture. By the middle of the century, however, many people recoiled in dismay at what had happened to the American arts, high and low, and thought that these old dreams of a common, unifying culture had been irrevocably crushed. The new technology of mass communications, for the most part, seemed to have achieved not a generous democratization but a bland homogenization of culture. Many people thought that the control of culture had passed into the hands of advertisers, people who used the means of a common culture just to make a buck. It was not only that most of the new music and drama that had been made for movies and radio, and later for television, seemed shallow; it was also that the high or serious culture that had become available through the means of mass reproduction seemed to have been reduced to a string of popularized hits, which concealed the real complexity of art. Culture, made democratic, had become too easy. Piet MondrianPiet Mondrian, photograph by Arnold Newman, 1942. (more)As a consequence, many intellectuals and artists around the end of World War II began to try to construct new kinds of elite high culture, art that would be deliberately difficultand to many people it seemed that this new work was merely difficult. Much of the new art and dance seemed puzzling and deliberately obscure. Difficult art happened, above all, in New York City. During World War II, New York had seen an influx of avant-garde artists escaping Adolf Hitlers Europe, including the painters Max Ernst, Piet Mondrian, and Joan Mir, as well as the composer Igor Stravinsky. They imported many of the ideals of the European avant-garde, particularly the belief that art should always be difficult and ahead of its time. (It is a paradox that the avant-garde movement in Europe had begun, in the late 19th century, in rebellion against what its advocates thought were the oppressive and stifling standards of high, official culture in Europe and that it had often looked to American mass culture for inspiration.) In the United States, however, the practice of avant-garde art became a way for artists and intellectuals to isolate themselves from what they thought was the cheapening of standards. And yet this counterculture had, by the 1960s, become in large American cities an official culture of its own. For many intellectuals around 1960, this gloomy situation seemed to be all too permanent. One could choose between an undemanding low culture and an austere but isolated high culture. For much of the century, scholars of culture saw these two worldsthe public world of popular culture and the private world of modern artas irreconcilable antagonists and thought that American culture was defined by the abyss between them. As the century and its obsessions closed, however, more and more scholars came to see in the most enduring inventions of American culture patterns of cyclical renewal between high and low. And as scholars have studied particular cases instead of abstract ideas, it has become apparent that the contrast between high and low has often been overdrawn. Instead of a simple opposition between popular culture and elite culture, it is possible to recognize in the prolix and varied forms of popular culture innovations and inspirations that have enlivened the most original high American cultureand to then see how the inventions of high culture circulate back into the street, in a spiraling, creative flow. In the astonishing achievements of the American jazz musicians, who took the popular songs of Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway musical and inflected them with their own improvisational genius; in the works of great choreographers like Paul Taylor and George Balanchine, who found in tap dances and marches and ballroom bebop new kinds of movement that they then incorporated into the language of high dance; in the dream boxes of the American avant-garde artist Joseph Cornell, who took for his material the mundane goods of Woolworths and the department store and used them as private symbols in surreal dioramas: in the work of all of these artists, and so many more, we see the same kind of inspiring dialogue between the austere discipline of avant-garde art and the enlivening touch of the vernacular. This argument has been so widely resolved, in fact, that, in the decades bracketing the turn of the 21st century, the old central and shaping American debate between high and low has been in part replaced by a new and, for the moment, still more clamorous argument. It might be said that if the old debate was between high and low, this one is between the centre and the margins. The argument between high and low was what gave the modern era its special savour. A new generation of critics and artists, defining themselves as postmodern, have argued passionately that the real central issue of culture is the construction of cultural values, whether high or low, and that these values reflect less enduring truth and beauty, or even authentic popular taste, than the prejudices of professors. Since culture has mostly been made by white males praising dead white males to other white males in classrooms, they argue, the resulting view of American culture has been made unduly pale, masculine, and lifeless. It is not only the art of African Americans and other minorities that has been unfairly excluded from the canon of what is read, seen, and taught, these scholars argue, often with more passion than evidence; it is also the work of anonymous artists, particularly women, that has been marginalized or treated as trivial. This argument can conclude with a rational, undeniable demand that more attention be paid to obscure and neglected writers and artists, or it can take the strong and often irrational form that all aesthetic values are merely prejudices enforced by power. If the old debate between high and low asked if real values could rise from humble beginnings, the new debate about American culture asks if true value, as opposed to mere power, exists at all. Adam Gopnik  Literature Because the most articulate artists are, by definition, writers, most of the arguments about what culture is and ought to do have been about what literature is and ought to doand this can skew our perception of American culture a little, because the most memorable American art has not always appeared in books and novels and stories and plays. In part, perhaps, this is because writing was the first art form to undergo a revolution of mass technology; books were being printed in thousands of copies, while one still had to make a pilgrimage to hear a symphony or see a painting. The basic dispute between mass experience and individual experience has been therefore perhaps less keenly felt as an everyday fact in writing in the 20th and 21st centuries than it has been in other art forms. Still, writers have seen and recorded this quarrel as a feature of the world around them, and the evolution of American writing in the past 50 years has shown some of the same basic patterns that can be found in painting and dance and the theatre. In the United States after World War II, many writers, in opposition to what they perceived as the bland flattening out of cultural life, made their subject all the things that set Americans apart from one another. Although for many Americans, ethnic and even religious differences had become increasingly less important as the century moved onholiday rather than everyday materialmany writers after World War II seized on these differences to achieve a detached point of view on American life. Beginning in the 1940s and 50s, three groups in particular seemed to be outsider-insiders who could bring a special vision to fiction: Southerners, Jews, and African Americans. Each group had a sense of uncertainty, mixed emotions, and stifled aspirations that lent a questioning counterpoint to the general chorus of affirmation in American life. The SouthernersWilliam Faulkner, Eudora Welty, and Flannery OConnor most particularlythought that a noble tradition of defeat and failure had been part of the fabric of Southern life since the Civil War. At a time when official American culture often insisted that the American story was one of endless triumphs and optimism, they told stories of tragic fate. Jewish writersmost prominently Chicago novelist Saul Bellow, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in l976, Bernard Malamud, and Philip Rothfound in the golden exile of Jews in the United States a juxtaposition of surface affluence with deeper unease and perplexity that seemed to many of their fellow Americans to offer a common predicament in a heightened form. At the turn of the 21st century, younger Jewish writers from the former Soviet Union such as Gary Shteyngart and Lara Vapnyar dealt impressively with the experience of immigrants in the United States. Bharati MukherjeeBharati Mukherjee, 2004.(more)Among the immigrant writers who explored the intersection of their old and new cultures at the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st were Cuban American writer Oscar Hijuelos, Antigua-born Jamaica Kincaid, Bosnian immigrant Aleksandar Hemon, Indian-born novelist and short-story writer Bharati Mukherjee, and Asian American writers Maxine Hong Kingston and Ha Jin. For African Americans, of course, the promise of American life had in many respects never been fulfilled. What happens to a dream deferred, the poet Langston Hughes asked, and many African American writers attempted to answer that question, variously, through stories that mingled pride, perplexity, and rage. African American literature achieved one of the few unquestioned masterpieces of late 20th-century American fiction writing in Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man (l952). Later two African American women, Toni Morrison (the first African American female to win the Nobel Prize for Literature; 1993), and Alice Walker, published some of the most important post-World War II American fiction. The rise of feminism as a political movement gave many women a sense that their experience too is richly and importantly outside the mainstream; since at least the 1960s, there has been an explosion of womens fiction, including the much-admired work of Joyce Carol Oates, Anne Tyler, Ann Beattie, Gail Godwin, and Alison Lurie. Let Us Now Praise Famous MenBud Fields and his family, Hale county, Alabama, photograph by Walker Evans, c. 193637; from the book Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941) by Evans and James Agee.(more)Perhaps precisely because so many novelists sought to make their fiction from experiences that were deliberately imagined as marginal, set aside from the general condition of American life, many other writers had the sense that fiction, and particularly the novel, might not any longer be the best way to try to record American life. For many writers the novel seemed to have become above all a form of private, interior expression and could no longer keep up with the extravagant oddities of the United States. Many gifted writers took up journalism with some of the passion for perfection of style that had once been reserved for fiction. The exemplars of this form of poetic journalism included the masters of The New Yorker magazine, most notably A.J. Liebling, whose books included The Earl of Louisiana  (1961), a study of an election in Louisiana, as well as Joseph Mitchell, who in his books The Bottom of the Harbour (1944) and Joe Goulds Secret (1942) offered dark and perplexing accounts of the life of the American metropolis. The dream of combining real facts and lyrical fire also achieved a masterpiece in the poet James Agees Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (l941; with photographs by Walker Evans), an account of sharecropper life in the South that is a landmark in the struggle for fact writing that would have the beauty and permanence of poetry. Tom WolfeAs the century continued, this genre of imaginative nonfiction (sometimes called the documentary novel or the nonfiction novel) continued to evolve and took on many different forms. In the writing of Calvin Trillin, John McPhee, Neil Sheehan, and Truman Capote, all among Lieblings and Mitchells successors at The New Yorker, this new form continued to seek a tone of subdued and even amused understatement. Tom Wolfe, whose influential books included The Right Stuff (1979), an account of the early days of the American space program, and Norman Mailer, whose books included Miami and the Siege of Chicago (1968), a ruminative piece about the Republican and Democratic national conventions in l968, deliberately took on huge public subjects and subjected them to the insights (and, many people thought, the idiosyncratic whims) of a personal sensibility. During the 1990s autobiography became the focus for a number of accomplished novelists, including Frank McCourt, Anne Roiphe, and Dave Eggers. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, massive, ambitious novels were published by David Foster Wallace (Infinite Jest, 1996) and Jonathan Franzen (The Corrections, 2001; Freedom, 2010). cover of The Catcher in the RyeReproduction of the cover of the first edition of J.D. Salingers novel The Catcher in the Rye (1951).(more)As the nonfiction novel often pursued extremes of grandiosity and hyperbole, the American short story assumed a previously unexpected importance in the life of American writing; the short story became the voice of private vision and private lives. The short story, with its natural insistence on the unique moment and the infrangible glimpse of something private and fragile, had a new prominence. The rise of the American short story is bracketed by two remarkable books: J.D. Salingers Nine Stories (1953) and Raymond Carvers collection What We Talk About When We Talk About Love (1981). Salinger inspired a generation by imagining that the serious search for a spiritual life could be reconciled with an art of gaiety and charm; Carver confirmed in the next generation their sense of a loss of spirituality in an art of taciturn reserve and cloaked emotions. Carver, who died in 1988, and the great novelist and man of letters John Updike, who died in 2009, were perhaps the last undisputed masters of literature in the high American sense that emerged with Ernest Hemingway and Faulkner. Yet in no area of the American arts, perhaps, have the claims of the marginal to take their place at the centre of the table been so fruitful, subtle, or varied as in literature. Perhaps because writing is inescapably personal, the trap of turning art into mere ideology has been most deftly avoided in its realm. This can be seen in the dramatically expanded horizons of the feminist and minority writers whose work first appeared in the 1970s and 80s, including the Chinese American Amy Tan. A new freedom to write about human erotic experience previously considered strange or even deviant shaped much new writing, from the comic obsessive novels of Nicholson Baker through the work of those short-story writers and novelists, including Edmund White and David Leavitt, who have made art out of previously repressed and unnarrated areas of homoerotic experience. Literature is above all the narrative medium of the arts, the one that still best relates What Happened to Me, and American literature, at least, has only been enriched by new mes and new narratives.

Education is compulsory for students aged 611 and free at all levelsprimary, secondary, technical school, and university. Montevideo is the national centre for higher education. The University of the Republic (1849) has numerous faculties, including a distinguished medical school that draws students from throughout the region. The Catholic University of Uruguay (1985) is a prominent private institution. The privately supported Institute of Higher Studies (1931) is devoted to scientific research, and vocational training is given by the Labour University of Uruguay (1878).   Cultural life Uruguayan culture reflects some of the same characteristics found in neighbouring Argentina. Both countries are strongly European (notably Spanish and Italian) in their orientation, and, unlike many Latin American countries, Uruguay is minimally influenced by indigenous culture. The tradition of the gaucho (cowboy, usually a mestizo) has been an important element in the art and folklore of both countries. Uruguays theatre and music are broadly based in terms of support and participation.  Daily life and social customs Beef is fundamental to Uruguayan cuisine, and the country is one of the worlds top consumers of red meat per capita. Barbecues (parrilladas) are ubiquitous. Popular foods include beef platters, steak sandwiches (chivitos), barbecued kidneys and sausages, and pastas. Locally produced soft drinks, beer, and wine are commonly served, as is cleric, a mixture of fruit juice and wine. Uruguay and Argentina share a national drink: mat (or yerba mat), a tea that is usually sipped from a gourd using a metal straw. Although some Uruguayan gauchos still dress in traditional trousers, ponchos, and wide-brimmed hats, most Uruguayans wear clothing styles that are also common to Europe and North America. Uruguays main holidays are New Years Day (January 1), Epiphany (January 6), Labour Day (May 1), and Christmas (December 25). Among the major patriotic holidays are Constitution Day (July 18), Independence Day (August 25), and the commemoration (April 19) of the arrival in 1825 of anticolonial leader Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band of 33 fighters.   The arts Jos Enrique RodJos Enrique Rod, c. 1917.(more)Jos Enrique Rod, a modernist, is considered Uruguays most significant literary figure. His book Ariel (1900), which stresses the importance of upholding spiritual over materialistic values, as well as resisting cultural dominance by Europe and the United States, continues to influence young writers. Outstanding among Latin American playwrights is Florencio Snchez; his plays, written around the beginning of the 20th century and dealing with contemporary social problems, are still performed. From about the same period and somewhat later came the romantic poetry of Juan Zorrilla de San Martn, Juana de Ibarbourou, and Delmira Agustini and the short stories of Horacio Quiroga. The psychological stories of Juan Carlos Onetti have earned widespread critical praise, as have the writings of Mario Benedetti. Uruguays best-known contemporary writer is Eduardo H. Galeano, author of Las venas abiertas de Amrica Latina (1971; The Open Veins of Latin America) and the trilogy Memoria del fuego (198287; Memory of Fire). Uruguayans of many classes and backgrounds enjoy reading historietas, comic books that often blend humour and fantasy with thinly veiled social criticism. The folk and popular music of Uruguay shares with Argentina not only its gaucho roots but also the tango, a musical and dance style that originated in Argentina. One of the most famous tangos, La cumparsita (1917), was written by the Uruguayan composer Gerardo Matos Rodrguez. The candombe is a folk dance performed at Carnival mainly by Uruguayans of African ancestry. The guitar is the preferred musical instrument; and, in a popular contest called the payada, two singers, each with a guitar, take turns improvising verses to the same tune. Numerous radio stations and musical events reflect the popularity of rock music (mainly imported from the United States and Europe, though some Uruguayan bands enjoy wide followings) and Caribbean genres known as msica tropical (tropical music). Early classical music in Uruguay showed heavy Spanish and Italian influence, but since the 20th century a number of composers of classical music, including Eduardo Fabini, Vicente Ascone, and Hctor Tosar, have made use of Latin American musical idioms. The 19th-century painter Juan Manuel Blanes, whose works depict historical events, was the first Uruguayan artist to gain widespread recognition. The Post-Impressionist painter Pedro Figari achieved international renown for his pastel studies of subjects in Montevideo and the countryside. Blending elements of art and nature, the work of the landscape architect Leandro Silva Delgado has also earned international prominence. Uruguay has a small but growing film industry, and movies such as Marcelo Bertalmos Los das con Ana (2000: Days with Ana) have earned international honours. New work is highlighted at the annual International Film Festival of Uruguay, held in Montevideo.   Cultural institutions Montevideo, the cultural heart of the country, is home to Uruguays principal cultural institutions, including the National Library and the national museums of history, anthropology, natural history, and art. Several regional museums, such as the Museum of the Indian and Gaucho in Tacuaremb, have well-maintained historical collections. The government supports two symphony orchestras, the National Theatre, and schools of dramatic arts, fine arts, and ballet. Private dramatic and musical groups also perform in Montevideo and other cities.  "},{"CountryName":"Uzbekistan","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life During the 1980s religious practice surged, transforming many aspects of Uzbek life, especially in the towns of the Fergana Valley and other concentrations of Muslim believers. This resurgence affected the republics cultural life through the increased activities of religious schools, neighbourhood mosques, religious orders, and religious publishing ventures and through the Islamic Renaissance Party. Over the centuries, the territory of what is now Uzbekistan has produced great scholars, poets, and writers whose heritage has enriched the general culture of humanity. The scholar and encyclopaedist al-Brn, who lived in the 11th century, produced a series of geographic works about India and a wide range of writings in the natural sciences and humanities. In the 15th century the astronomer and mathematician Ulgh Beg founded a famous observatory in Samarkand. The late 15th-century scholar, poet, and writer Al Shr Nav greatly advanced Turkic-language literature and was also a talented artist and composer. The major writers of the early 20th century broke from the Nav tradition in their style but continued to revere it in their literary history. In the Jadid era (190020) the foremost modern poets and prose writers included Abdalrauf Fitrat, Sadriddin Ayni, and Abdullah Qadiri, each of whom was bilingual in Uzbek and Tajik. These writers all began as poets and subsequently branched out to produce many of the first modern indigenous plays, stories, and novels of Central Asia. The younger poets Batu, Cholpn (Abdulhamid Sulayman Yuns), and Elbek (Mashriq Yunus Oghli) offered metres and rhyme schemes quite different from the verse composed in the traditions long employed by the poets of the region. Fitrat gained fame and popularity for such prose and poetic dialogues as Munazara (1909; The Dispute), and Mahmud Khoja Behbudiy became known for a stage tragedy, Padarkush (1913; The Patricide). Abdullah Qadiri became known for a first Uzbek historical novel, Otgn kunlr (192226; Days Gone By), and Cholpan introduced a new lyricism in his short poems. Hamza Hakim-Zada Niyaziy was also an early 20th-century playwright and poet later much favoured by Soviet authorities for his simplified, class-oriented plots and subjects. Most of these writers died violently either during the Russian Civil War or, more commonly, in Joseph Stalins purges of the 1930s. As a result, Uzbekistans intellectual and cultural life suffered trauma for decades to come. Only since independence have its finest modern authors regained posthumous recognition. During the second half of the 20th century there was a great increase in the number of writers but not in the quality of the writing. Until the 1980s most Soviet Uzbek authors produced tendentious novels, plays, and verse in line with official Communist Party themes. Among the older generation of contemporary authors is Asqad Mukhtar (b. 1921), whose Socialist Realist novel Ap singillr (Sisters; original and translation published during the 1950s), has been translated into English and other languages. Mukhtar, along with others of his generation, effectively encouraged the creative efforts of younger Uzbek poets and authors, a group far less burdened than their elders by the sloganeering characteristic of Soviet Socialist Realism. Among these newer voices, Razzaq Abdurashid, Abduqahhar Ibrahim, Jamal Kamal, and Erkin Wahid, all born in the 1930s, and Rauf Parfi, Halima Khudayberdiy, Muhammad Ali, Sharaf Bashbek, Mamadali Mahmud, all born in the 1940s or later, stand out. Several of these new writers have contributed striking dramas and comedies to the theatre of Uzbekistan. Privately organized drama and theatre were very active in Samarkand, Margilan, Tashkent, and other cities before 1917. In the difficult economic situation of the 1990s, however, the loss of government subsidies led to a drastic decline in theatrical activity, and the cinema and television have further emptied the seats in legitimate theatres. Musical tradition throughout southern Central Asia provides a distinctive classical form of composition in the great cycles of maqoms handed down from master performers to apprentices. Television and radio as well as concert halls offer maqom cycles in live performances. Uzbekistans cultural heritage includes magnificent monuments in the national architectural tradition: the mausoleum of the Smnid ruler Isml I (9th and 10th centuries) in Bukhara, the great mosques and mausoleums of Samarkand, constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries, and many other fine tombs, mosques, palaces, and madrasahs. An interesting recent development is the reclamation, renovation, and reconsecration of many smaller old mosques, some very elegant though badly damaged; these had been relegated by communist authorities to serve as garages, storehouses, shops, slaughterhouses, or museums. Muslim rebuilders now accurately reconstruct these damaged buildings as part of a comprehensive drive to re-create the Islamic life suppressed by the communists between 1920 and 1990.

The great states of Bactria, Khwrezm, and Sogdiana emerged during the 1st millennium bce in the fertile region around the Amu Darya, which served as a centre of trade and cultural exchange on the Silk Road between East and West. After the 8th-century-ce introduction of Islam into Central Asia, several streams of population flowed into the territory now forming the land of Uzbekistan. Some migrations contributed to the demographic diversity that characterizes Uzbekistan. Before the lasting conquest by the Russians in the late 19th century, however, military invaders generally withdrew from the area soon after they arrived. Arabs after 711 ce, Mongols under Genghis Khan from the 13th century, Dzungars in the 15th17th century, and Persians in the 18th century exerted less impact upon the makeup of the population than upon the social and political systems, because they left behind relatively small, assimilable numbers of their people. "},{"CountryName":"Vanuatu","CulturalInfo":"Government and society Under the terms of the 1980 constitution, the president, who serves as head of state, is elected to a five-year term by an electoral college made up of the unicameral Parliament and the presidents of the Regional Councils. Members of Parliament are elected to four-year terms on the basis of universal franchise. Parliament elects the chief executive, the prime minister, from among its members; the prime minister then appoints a Council of Ministers. The constitution also provides for a National Council of Chiefs (Malvatumauri), composed of elected custom chiefs, which advises the government on matters relating to custom and tradition. Provincial authorities are responsible for local governmental functions. The Supreme Court is the ultimate judicial arbiter of both civil and criminal matters. There are also a court of appeal and magistrates courts, and island courts may be established by warrant to rule on land disputes. Since independence, defense has been provided through a pact with Papua New Guinea. Vanuatu has no regular military, but the countrys police force operates a domestic paramilitary unit, the Vanuatu Mobile Force. Health care in Vanuatu consists of a main hospital in Vila supplemented by smaller hospitals, clinics, and dispensaries on the other islands. Malaria, tuberculosis, hookworm, and gastroenteritis are the most common diseases. Although attempts have been made since independence to institute a single, English-speaking education system, ongoing economic aid from France for the maintenance of the Francophone school system has ensured that about half of ni-Vanuatu children receive French-language instruction. Education is free and compulsory for ages 6 to 12, but only about one-third of ni-Vanuatu children undertake postprimary education. The countrys school attendance and adult literacy rates are among the lowest in the Pacific, a situation exacerbated by rapid population growth, the distance between settlements, and a shortage of teachers and classrooms in remote areas. The University of the South Pacifics Emalus Campus at Port-Vila (opened in 1989) provides undergraduate and graduate education; the universitys law school is there, and students may also study at the universitys main campus in Suva, Fiji. A small number of ni-Vanuatu pursue higher education in Papua New Guinea or in France. Cultural life The overwhelming majority of ni-Vanuatu are subsistence agriculturalists, living in small rural villages where activities revolve around the land. The constitution guarantees that land cannot be alienated from its indigenous custom owners, or traditional owners, and their descendants. More than an economic resource, land is the physical embodiment of the metaphysical link with the past, and identification with a particular tract of land (expressed by the Bislama phrase man ples) remains one of the fundamental concepts governing ni-Vanuatu culture, although foreign developers have gained control over some land through long-term leases. On many islands, men gather nightly at their local nakamal (mens house) to drink kava and communicate with the spirits of their ancestors, whose bones typically are buried nearby. Through magic stones, they attempt to contact and control the spiritual realm they view as all-pervasive. Among the vast majority of rural dwellers, kastom (custom), along with Christianity, continues to guide daily life."},{"CountryName":"Venezuela","CulturalInfo":" Education of VenezuelaBasic education is free and compulsory between the ages of 6 and 15. Secondary education, which lasts for 2 years, is also free but not required. More than nine-tenths of Venezuelans age 15 and older are literate. The vast majority of Venezuelan children are enrolled in school, but nearly half the adults have no secondary education and a large number have no formal schooling. Most middle- and upper-class parents send their children to private elementary and secondary schools. The number of institutions of higher education expanded rapidly in the latter part of the 20th century. Higher education is provided by private and public institutions, and approximately one-fourth of secondary school graduates attend them. Caracas is an educational centre with several notable universities, including the Central University of Venezuela (founded in 1721) and the National Open University (1977). Among the more prominent state schools are the University of Zulia (1946), the University of Carabobo (1852), and the University of the Andes (1810) in Mrida. Modernization and urbanization in the 20th century brought considerable improvement in the educational system; however, the economic difficulties of the 1980s and 90s and government mismanagement damaged the system. Although Venezuela greatly increased education spending in the latter part of the 20th century, nearly half the money allocated was spent on universities, while primary and secondary schools suffered from poorly trained teachers and high student dropout rates. In addition, students received on average only half the mandated days of instruction because of vacation days and time lost to strikes. In an attempt to remedy these problems, the government began to restructure the educational system in the late 1990s.   Health and welfare The government greatly expanded health and welfare services during the 1970s, particularly in the cities. Both public (free) and private medical assistance were made available. The Ministry of Health is responsible for organizing and staffing the public hospitals and rural medical centres. Even before the onset of the economic crisis that began in 2015, the ministry had to dealt with numerous budgetary and management problems, including physician strikes and poorly maintained hospitals. Similarly, the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security, which offered medical and welfare assistance to urban workers and employees, also experienced difficulties, including large deficits, in advance of the crippling of the health care system that resulted from the economic collapse. In the area of housing, the metropolitan authorities have been unable to meet the needs of the urban poor. The problems of the ranchos persist, as public housing schemes mainly meet the needs of middle-income groups while largely leaving poorer urbanites to find employment and housing on their own.   Cultural life  Daily life Maracaibo, VenezuelaStreet scene in Maracaibo, Venezuela.(more)As Venezuelans moved from the countryside to the cities, they developed a modern urban lifestyle; large middle-class neighbourhoods developed alongside burgeoning poor ranchos. Many middle- and upper-class Venezuelans acquired wealth from oil in the 1950s70s, which enabled them to travel easily, especially to the United States, and to own cars and houses. The economic downturn since the 1980s has interrupted that easy lifestyle, however, and poverty has grown. In Venezuela the admixture of African, European, and indigenous cultural traditions is often called criollo (Creole), although that term in most Latin American contexts denotes people of European ancestry. Venezuelans boast criollo foods, dances, and, especially, music. National foods include arepa (a cornmeal bread) and hallaca (sweet cornmeal dough cooked in banana leaves). Other typical foods include passion fruit and tamarinds, tequeos (cheese pastries), pabelln (a stew of beef, rice, and black beans served over fried plantains), and pulpo (octopus) cooked in citrus juice. During the pre-Lenten Carnival more elaborate dishes are served, such as paella and talkar de chivo (kid stew). Locally produced beer and rum are popular, as is coffee served in many different styles, each with its own name reflecting the amount of milk added to the coffee. Although North American music is popular and widespread in Venezuela, the Caribbean salsa and merengue forms are also commonly heard. The national Venezuelan folk dance and musical style is the joropa, but each region of the country has its own distinctive musical expression. (See also Native American arts: Northern South America.)   The arts Since the 1920s the government has promoted artistic expression as a way to maintain cultural autonomy in the face of foreign influences. As greater freedom for writing and publishing was granted, a flourishing national literature emerged. Rmulo Gallegos, who became Venezuelas best-known writer, was part of this nationalistic wave, gaining international recognition for his novel Doa Brbara (1929). Such painters as Armando Revern and Manuel Cabr also expressed nationalistic fervour. The architect Carlos Ral Villanueva won international acclaim for his design of the Central University in Caracas, which featured asymmetrically arranged buildings complemented by freestanding murals and sculpture. The state-supported Venezuelan Symphony Orchestra is highly popular, and its repertoire also reflects a spirit of nationalism. Also of great pride is the Simn Bolvar Youth Orchestra in Caracas, which boasts some of the countrys best young musicians. Some of these musicians are recruited from a comprehensive orchestral training and music education program known in Venezuela as El Sistema (The System). The program, which was created in the 1970s, offers hundreds of thousands of children from underprivileged and at-risk communities the opportunity to play in youth orchestras throughout the country, and each state in Venezuela has at least one professional youth orchestra.   Cultural institutions Don Quixote balletDon Quixote ballet, Teresa Carreo Theatre, Caracas.(more)Most of Venezuelas major cultural institutions are located in Caracas. The Museum of Fine Arts (founded in 1938) houses a large collection of paintings and sculptures by both Venezuelan and foreign artists. Other museums include the Museum of Colonial Art, housed in an 18th-century mansion, and the Science Museum Foundation (founded in 1875 as the National Museum), which contains exhibits on archaeology, anthropology, and other disciplines. Among the noteworthy museums outside Caracas are a museum of pre-Columbian artifacts in Ciudad Bolvar and the Museum of Military History in Maracaibo. The most important book collections are at the National Library (1883) in Caracas, which holds more than two million volumes, including many rare books. The modern Teresa Carreo Theatre provides a forum for international and national music and dance performances.  "},{"CountryName":"Vietnam","CulturalInfo":"Health and welfare Before reunification, health services were underdeveloped in the rural areas of the south but were well-developed in the north. After 1975 the northern system was extended to the south, and there was a general increase in health facilities and personnel. Although the health care system is one of the socialist states greatest achievements, like all other programs in Vietnam it has been severely hampered by a lack of funds since the late 1970s. The numbers of hospital beds and facilities have not kept pace with population growth, and upgrades to water supplies and sewerage systems have proceeded more slowly than anticipated. Much responsibility for health care was transferred to provincial governments in the late 1980s, and patients started to be charged for many medical services. Despite financial challenges, government spending as a percentage of GDP more than doubled between the mid-1990s and the early years of the 21st century. As a result, clean water was made accessible to some three-fourths of the population, malaria was largely brought under control, and the countrys general bill of health improved considerably. There was simultaneously a sharp increase in the number of physicians, and a substantial drop in infant mortality. The prevalence of tuberculosis has been a continuing concern. With international assistance, the government has taken aggressive steps to combat the disease, and it has achieved some of its goals ahead of schedule. Another concern has been avian influenza (bird flu), Vietnam being the epicentre of a major outbreak in the early 21st century. HIV infection and cases of AIDS have risen in the country, but they have not reached epidemic levels. The government has striven to contain the disease near the world average with help from international sources. Because carriers of HIV and victims of AIDS have been subject to severe discrimination in Vietnam, it is suspected that many cases have not been reported. The countrys welfare system has largely focused on the victims of the Vietnam War (195475) and their families. Government insurance programs provide for old age, invalidity, work injury, sickness, maternity, and death. Education The Vietnamese, with their Confucian traditions, have always placed great importance on education. Rural education in the south was badly disrupted during the war years, and all religious and private schools were nationalized after 1975. The government subsequently pursued a policy of educational reform. Nine years of schooling are mandatory and are divided into five years of primary and four years of lower-secondary school. Continuing students are enrolled either in an academic or a vocational upper-secondary program, which lasts three years. A major restructuring of higher education occurred in the mid-1990s. During that time, the University of Hanoi (founded by the French in 1906 and refounded in 1956) was combined with other institutions and faculties to become Vietnam National University, the largest multidisciplinary institution of higher learning in the country, with campuses in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Other new universities were established in the 1990s, and the number of faculty members grew substantially. Although such changes have significantly increased opportunities for advanced education in Vietnam, expansion of the network has not been in proportion to the increase in the number of students. Literacy rates are high. Emphasis is placed on training in science and technology and, with the advent of market reforms, on economics and business. Several thousand students are sent abroad each year. While most students once went to the Soviet Union and the countries of eastern Europe, increasing numbers are now studying in Western countries (including the United States) or in Japan, especially since admission of Vietnam into the WTO in 2007.Cultural life Chinese influence permeated all aspects of traditional Vietnamese culture, while Western influences became strong in the 20th century. Since the loosening of economic and political controls in the late 1980s, Vietnam has experienced both increased exposure to the lifestyles of the capitalist world and a resurfacing of old cultural practices. Folk traditions such as shamanism and soothsaying have experienced a revival despite official disapproval.  Daily life and social customs VietnamWomen wearing ao dai, traditional Vietnamese attire.(more)Vietnams Confucian heritage is evident in the importance the Vietnamese give to the family. Families are essentially patrilineal, but Vietnamese women work alongside men in many jobs and play a major role in raising children and managing family finances. When possible, the Vietnamese prefer to work from early morning until early evening, with an extended rest period during the midday heat. In rural areas, both men and women wear trousers and shirts or blouses. On formal occasions and in urban areas, Western-style clothing is common, including skirts and blouses for women. Women still sometimes wear a form of the traditional ao dai, a long, slit tunic worn over pants. Rice is the staple food. Vietnamese cuisine incorporates elements of both Chinese cooking and the cuisines of other Southeast Asian countries. Noodle soup with chicken or beef broth (pho), a distinctive kind of spring roll (cha gio), and the use of fermented fish sauce (nuoc mam) for dipping and seasoning are among the many noteworthy dishes. Vietnamese entrepreneurDavid Tran, a former major in theSouth Vietnamese army, made hissriracha chili sauce, and its bright red bottles with a large logo of a rooster, world famous afteremigratingto the United States in 1979 and selling his productto restaurants and customers indiasporaVietnamese and Thaicommunitiesthroughout the Los Angelesmetropolitan area, where he had settled.Throughoutcities in Vietnam elaborate meals are available in expensive air-conditioned restaurants, but Vietnamese take delight in snacking at street stalls and entertaining friends in open-air establishments. Vietnams most important holiday, the lunar new year celebration known as Tet, is a time of feasting, visiting, and exchanging gifts.  The arts Literature Vietnamese poetry was written exclusively in Chinese until the end of the 13th century. By the 15th century, however, a demotic script called Chu Nom, or the southern script, had evolved into a vehicle for writing in vernacular Vietnamese. The Chinese heritage of the elite merged with local oral tradition, producing a truly Vietnamese literature. A distinctively Vietnamese long narrative poem in verse developed, culminating in the masterpiece of national literature, Kim Van Kieu (The Tale of Kieu), by Nguyen Du (17651820). In the 20th century, Vietnamese literature came to be written in a Roman alphabetical script (Quoc-ngu). In the 1930s a modern Vietnamese literature developed under French influence, featuring poetry, novels, and short stories. Between 1954 and 1975 a cosmopolitan literature stressing creativity and individual freedom flourished in the south, while a state-sponsored literature of Socialist Realism was promoted in the north. After 1975 Socialist Realism became a national orthodoxy, although in the 1980s literature became more lively and diverse in content. During the 1990s writers tested the limits of their literary freedom, and since the start of the 21st century authors have continued to be bound by both explicit and tacit limitations and generally have practiced self-censorship. Politics has remained a taboo topic. Theatre Discover the ancient traditional art of water puppetry of VietnamOverview of water puppetry in Hanoi.(more)See all videos for this articleInitially, under communist rule the theatre was strictly controlled, and all professional performers and other technical staff became employees of the state. A government policy inaugurated in the 1990s, however, was designed to dissolve the state monopoly on the arts and other areas of cultural production. By the early 21st century, many small, for-profit theatre groups were operating across the country, especially in urban areas. Women have figured prominently in all aspects of these new artistic ventures since their inception. Although scripts continue to be monitored, censorship is much less harsh than it was in earlier years of the communist regime. In addition to many new plays, which have aesthetic roots in western European dramatic tradition, the indigenous cai luong, a satirical musical comedy genre that emerged in the south in the early 20th century, is still enormously popular. There also are theatrical troupes specializing in a genre of Chinese opera adaptations (called hat tuong in the north and hat boi in the south), popular operettas (hat cheo) of indigenous origin, circus performances, and mua roi nuoc, a distinct form of Vietnamese puppetry, in which performances take place on a pool or pond. The water animates the puppets and covers the manipulating apparatuses, which are operated by puppeteers, who stand in the water, hidden behind a screen. A separate group of musicians and singers follows the movement of the puppets closely, providing voices for them in the style of the hat cheo theatre. Water puppetry began to experience a resurgence toward the end of the 20th century, with growth in the number of national competitions and internationally touring troupes. Music During the Second Indochina War, the Communist Party attempted to shape the development of modern popular music, promoting revolutionary tunes and themes as alternatives to the Western romantic and rock-inspired forms that had developed in the south. Following reunification in 1975, the government confiscated sheet music and cassette tapes of music it deemed depressing, defeatist, or licentious, yet this music continued to be played in private and spread to the north as well. Tapes and compact discs of Western-style rock bands and popular singers who fled the south in the 1970s, as well as recordings made by Western artists, have been smuggled into the country from abroad, reproduced by the thousands, and sold in the streets. Music the authorities generally judge to be alien, decadent, or noxious, but seem powerless to suppress, may be heard in coffee shops and karaoke bars. As has been the case with other areas in the arts, however, restrictions loosened somewhat toward the end of the 20th century. Increasing numbers of artists began cultivating new sounds that blended elements of jazz, gospel, Motown, and other Western genres with Vietnamese language and musical sensibilities. Western popular music, once the primary fare of Vietnams youth, has begun to yield to local popular styles. Despite the prevalence of popular forms, traditional music has maintained an important place, politically and culturally, in Vietnamese society. The government has long advocated a traditional but modern approach to Vietnamese music. This has ultimately entailed the recasting of traditional repertoire into a Western harmonic and stylistic framework, and the structural adjustment of Vietnamese instruments to accommodate the changes. Although the resultant music, called cai bien, is of relatively recent origin, it is often presented officially as the Vietnamese music of antiquity. Cai bien has been created primarily by Vietnamese composers trained solidly, if not solely, in the Western classical music tradition. Western classical music is well-established in Vietnamese music education. The country has several conservatories, largely staffed by musicians who have studied music in prestigious schools of Russia and eastern Europe. Although it is possible in Vietnam to specialize in either Vietnamese or Western traditions, Western music fundamentals serve as the point of departure for all formal music study. Visual arts Painting has developed slowly and unevenly, bound first by traditional Chinese forms, then by a style imitative of French Impressionism, and more recently by Socialist Realism. High-quality lacquerware, however, continues to be produced. Unique local arts persist among the peoples of the central highlands. Women weave blankets and clothing, while men weave baskets and mats. Crossbows and figures are carved from hardwoods. The Hmong are especially recognized for their needlework, and although the Cham and Khmer minorities retain some idiosyncratic arts, their traditions seem to be losing practitioners. Artists have enjoyed increased freedom to express themselves under doi moi, and the contemporary art scene has often been described as vibrant. The preeminent institution of art education is Hanoi University of Fine Arts. Several graduates of this state institution known as the Gang of Five (Viet Dung, Ha Tri Hieu, Tran Luong, Pham Quang Vinh, and Dang Xuan Ha) were influenced by mainstream Modernism, ignored social commentary in their work, and achieved considerable success in art galleries around the Pacific Rim during the mid-1990s. Most artists of Modernist bent have sold their work through private galleries, and government censors have occasionally forced galleries to remove works they consider too bold. An example was the removal in 1997 of paintings on themes of homosexuality by Truong Tan. One of the few female artists, Dinh Y Nhi, is noted for paintings of women in traditional dress and poses but done in untraditional shades of gray and black. A modern take on traditional themes is common, an abstract one rare. Dinh Quan, Trinh Tuan, and Cong Kim Hoa, however, have focused on the traditional medium of lacquer to experiment with Abstract Expressionism. Nguyen Bao Ha has also worked in the Abstract Expressionist genre. The small domestic film industry that emerged in Saigon during the 1950s produced a steady fare of romances, costume dramas, and adaptations of cai luong operettas until 1975. Hanoi produced its first motion picture in 1959 and used the medium primarily for propaganda. From reunification until 1989, the state held a monopoly over the production and distribution of motion pictures, subsidizing a handful of state-owned film studios and companies. A few movies made in this period experimented with themes and perspectives that tested the boundaries of official tolerance, but economic reform has done more to change the industry. Faced with budget cutbacks, cinematographers in the 1990s abandoned celluloid for video to make money on the open market. Numerous private companies sprang up to churn out cheap videos featuring kung fu fights, car chases, and romance. Pirated videotapes and later, video compact discs (VCDs), from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States also enjoyed popularity. In an effort to encourage production and competition in the film industry, and to draw people back into the cinemas, the Ministry of Culture and Information in 2002 ended mandatory review (and censorship) of scripts prior to filming, allowed the establishment of private film studios, and opened the industry as a whole to private and international investment. Since that time, filmmakers have been treating topics that were untouchable under earlier government regulations, motivated by the possibility of presenting a realistic image of contemporary Vietnamese society. Ha Dong Silk Dress and Bride of Silence, both released in 2005, are products of the liberalized industry and champions of the new aesthetic, and are among the growing number of Vietnamese films to have won international acclaim. Cultural institutions Vietnam abounds with a variety of historical sites. Hanoi contains the 11th-century Temple of Literature, the One Pillar Pagoda, and many other ancient structures. The countrys political and military past is on display in the capital at the Vietnam Revolution Museum, the Army Museum, and a large complex that includes Ho Chi Minhs mausoleum, the house he lived in as president, and the Ho Chi Minh Museum. Hanoi is also home to the Vietnam History Museum, the National Art Gallery, and the National Library. More recent Hanoi institutions include the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology, devoted to the research, documentation, preservation, and display of the countrys ethnic diversity, and the Hanoi Womens Museum, dedicated to illuminating the public and private lives of the Vietnamese women. In Vietnams central region, Hue and its environs contain the royal citadel of the last dynasty and numerous royal mausoleums and tombs, as well as many Buddhist pagodas. A number of these structures collectively were designated a World Heritage site in 1993. Hoi An, a port city just south of Da Nang that flourished between the 15th and 19th centuries, was added to the World Heritage list in 1999, along with the nearby 4th13th-century Hindu ruins at My Son Sanctuary. Ho Chi Minh City in the south has a noteworthy zoo and botanical garden on the edge of the downtown area. "},{"CountryName":"Yemen","CulturalInfo":" Government and society The former states of North Yemen and South Yemen had sharply contrasting political systems. North Yemen was a republic governed nominally under a constitution adopted in 1970, suspended in 1974, and largely restored between 1978 and the late 1980s. Although a succession of bodies carried out some of the functions of a legislature, they exercised little real power until the late 1980s. During that period, policy making remained in the hands of a relatively progressive military elite that worked closely with a variety of civilians that included a large and growing group of technocrats, the major tribal leaders, and other traditional conservative notables. Although political parties were formally banned, several parties did exist and operated with varying degrees of influence during and between elections. South Yemen, also republican in form, had an avowedly Marxist regime, and the political system and economy reflected many of the goals and organizational structures of its scientific socialism. The Yemen Socialist Party (YSP), the only legal political organization, determined government policy and exercised control over the state administrative system, the legislature, and the military. The unified political system created in 1990 represented a pronounced departure from either of the previous ones, in theory and, to a large extent, in practice. The most important change was the decision to establish a multiparty representative democracy.  Constitutional framework The 1990 constitution (amended in 1994 and 2001) called for those rights and institutions usually associated with a liberal parliamentary democracy. The head of state is the president, who appoints the vice president and the prime minister; the latter is the head of government. The president, elected by direct popular vote, holds office for no more than two seven-year terms and is assisted by a cabinet. The bicameral legislature consists of two houses: the House of Representatives, whose members are elected by universal adult suffrage every six years, and the Shr (Consultative) Council, whose members are appointed by the president. The legislature oversees the executive, discusses and drafts legislation, and authorizes government budgets and economic plans. The constitution may be modified with a two-thirds vote by the House of Representatives.   Local government The issue of redefining territorial and administrative subdivisions after union was complex. In the north the provinces had corresponded to more or less obvious topographical regions. Each province was subdivided into qa (district) and niyah (tract) levels, largely representing distinctions within the population (e.g., tribal affiliations). In the south, under the British, there had been a major distinction regarding administrative autonomy and political influence between the city of Aden (governed directly from London via the colonial office) and the hinterland, which was divided into more than 20 statelets, many of which were clearly associated with ancient tribal groupings of one form or another. In order to break down the old tribal affiliations and the associated economic and political factionalism, the postindependence government abolished these traditional units and reorganized the country into governorates (mufat). United Yemen eventually embraced a system based, as in South Yemen, on a series of governorates20 in total, not counting Sanaa, which forms its own unit. The governorates are in turn divided into several hundred districts. The governors of the governorates are appointed by the federal president, but each jurisdiction has its own elected council. An important issue that remains to be resolved is the amount of authority that the governorates will have in the federal system. The trend in both the north and the south was to provide the governorates with a high degree of autonomy. The first municipal elections under the Local Authority Law (1999) were held in 2001. However, Yemen has lacked the infrastructural resources to conduct efficient local elections, and safeguards providing protection from the interference of the central government have been slow to materialize.   Justice The two parts of the new state had markedly contrasting legal traditions. In the north the legal system had been a mix of Sharah (Islamic law) and urf (tribal custom). In the south the legal system was a mixture of Sharah in matters of personal status (e.g., marriage, divorce, inheritance) and British commercial and common law (modified to suit the needs of the Marxist government) and, in rural areas, a combination of Sharah and urf. New legal codes were promulgated in 199194. Each district has a court of first instance, and each governorate has a court of appeals; the Supreme Court is located at the capital. These courts have full competency to hear all civil and criminal cases. The Supreme Judicial Council oversees the court system. There are a number of specialized courts. Under the constitution, Sharah is the source of all legislation.   Political process There are a number of active political parties at the national level, but the composition and membership of political parties are regulated by law. Parties based on such factors as regional, tribal, sectarian, or ethnic persuasion are expressly prohibited. Each party must seek a license from a state committee to legally exist. The most successful party by far is the General Peoples Congress; other parties include Il (the Yemeni Congregation for Reform), the Nasserite Unionist Party, and several socialist organizations. Al-aqq Party, active in the 1990s, represented the interests of a Zayd revivalist movement that began in the 1980s; it precipitated the rise of the Houthi movement, whose rebellion in the early 21st century escalated in the 2010s into a civil war that drew the participation of other regional actors.   Security The combined armed forces of Yemen, including army, air force, and navy, are small and poorly equipped by the standards of the region. Since the unification of the state in 1990, the manpower of Yemens conventional army has suffered a general decline. The extensive inventories of Eastern-bloc weapons that the country inherited rapidly became dated, and many weapons systems were discarded. The military consists of volunteers serving two-year enlistments, and there is no consistent military educational or professional development system or enlisted personnel or officers. Military strength has been augmented by a large number of paramilitary forces, mostly associated with the Ministry of the Interior. Also, there are a relatively small number of reservists and tribal levies that the government can call on in times of emergency. Military officers have often involved themselves in political affairs: in the north the military played the dominant role in the political system following the overthrow of the civilian government by Col. Ibrhm al-amd in 1974. Internal security is a major concern of the government. The Political Security Organization is the major intelligence organ of the state; police and paramilitary groups provide security, and the Criminal Investigation Department conducts criminal investigations.   Health and welfare Despite the generally healthy climate of the Yemeni highlands, where most of the population lives, the standard of public health remains very low. Contributing factors include: (1) unsanitary water supplies, (2) numerous cultural patterns that compromise both personal and group hygiene, (3) the presence of numerous diseases at endemic rates (e.g., malaria in the coastal belt and gastroenteritis in the highlands), (4) the very high birth rate, and (5) insufficient personnel and financial resources to provide modern medical care and to undertake any massive public health programs. There are various programs supported and operated by foreign donors that address these needs to some degree. Sanaa and Aden have numerous hospitals, but few meet Western standards of sanitation and medical practice.   Housing Shibam, Yemen: mud-brick housesThe mud-brick multistory houses of Shibam, Yemen.(more)Although Yemeni architecture is among the loveliest and most fascinating in the Arab world, housing stock in general tends to be of poor quality. There are two basic housing types: houses of reed, thatch, and mud brick, which are largely found in coastal regions; and houses of stone and mud brick, which are more frequently found in the highlands. Throughout the country, access to fresh water and hygienic sewage disposal is poor. Houses with running water, internal sewage systems, and electricity remain the exception in most parts of the country, particularly in rural areas, where only a small fraction have indoor plumbing.   Education Modern systems of education were established in both Yemens during the 1960s, but limited resources and a high birth rate ensured that education continued to reach only a fraction of school-age children. For a variety of social and cultural reasons, certain subgroups of the school-age populationmost notably girlsremained underrepresented in the system. Despite the dramatic expansion of teacher training, the lack of adequately qualified Yemeni teachers was a major problem in the north; Egyptian and other Arab expatriates largely filled this void. The overall literacy rate remains relatively low, and the disparity between males and females is large. More than two-thirds of men and less than one-third of women are literate. Partly because of an inadequate infrastructure that includes classroom shortages and poor materials and facilities, only a portion of eligible children enroll in school. Among those who do attend, only a small fraction go on to complete secondary education. Higher education is limited to a very small minority. The University of Sanaa (founded 1970), established largely with grants from Kuwait, is coeducational and comprises a variety of specialized collegese.g., those of agriculture, medicine, commerce, and law. The University of Aden (1975) offers a similar array of specialties. These two senior institutions of higher learning have spawned universities and colleges throughout Yemen, and there are now several small colleges as well as vocational and polytechnic institutes in the larger urban centres that provide training in a variety of fields. However, wealthy families typically send their children abroad for higher education. In addition, both of the major Muslim sects operate religious institutes for the preparation of judges and other religious personnel, although this often requires additional study at such well-known institutions as al-Azhar University in Cairo. By the early 21st century the number of small religious schools associated with foreign Islamic groups had proliferated. Several thousand small religious academies were closed in 2005, and all non-Yemenis matriculating in unregistered schools were asked to leave the country for fear such institutions were involved in religious extremism.   Cultural life Yemen is a part of the Islamic world and as such reflects many of the contemporary trends in Islam. Most Yemenis are Muslim and are tolerant of non-Muslims as well as of the various branches of Islam. While proud of their Islamic heritage, Yemenis are also intensely proud of their pre-Islamic history, including that of the Saba and aramawt kingdoms. In their extensive networks of overland and maritime trade, the ancient Yemenis encountered myriad cultures and civilizations. There is ample evidence of Greek, Roman, Indian, Indonesian, and Chinese influence on various aspects of both traditional and contemporary Yemeni culture. "},{"CountryName":"Zambia","CulturalInfo":"Education of ZambiaAt independence Zambia had one of the most poorly developed education systems of Britains former colonies, with just 109 university graduates and less than 0.5 percent of the population estimated to have completed primary education. Among these, African women were almost entirely absent. The country has since invested heavily in education at all levels. Compulsory primary education begins at seven years of age and lasts for seven years. Secondary education is divided into two cycles, the first lasting two years and the second lasting three years. More than two-thirds of adult Zambians are literate, although the rates of literacy are significantly higher among men than among women. The University of Zambia was opened in Lusaka in 1966 and graduated its first students in 1969. The university offers courses in agriculture, education, engineering, humanities and social sciences, law, medicine, mining, natural sciences, and veterinary medicine. The basic program is four years, although engineering and medical courses are of five and seven years duration, respectively. Copperbelt University, formerly a part of the University of Zambia, achieved independent university status in 1987 and is located at Kitwe. It offers courses of study within its business, built-environment, natural resources, and technology schools. The language of instruction for both universities is English. Other tertiary-level institutions are vocationally focused and include the Evelyn Hone College of Applied Arts and Commerce and the Natural Resources Development College, both in Lusaka, and the Zambia College of Agriculture and Northern Technical College, located in Monze and Ndola, respectively.Cultural life Cultural milieu Since the 1950s the Zambian cultural scene has been transformed by large-scale urbanization and exposure to exotic influences from Europe, the Americas, and other parts of Africa. The popularity of soukous dance hall music from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, has overwhelmed interest in indigenous music. Foreign aid in the form of second-hand Western clothing (called salaula) has had a negative effect on the domestic clothing industry. With the object of preserving cultural diversity, government initiatives have led to the revival of many traditional ceremonies. Some, such as the kuomboka of the Lozia now-ceremonial trip to higher ground (the flood capital) from the Zambezi floodplain during the rivers annual floodsurvived essentially unchanged; others have taken up new forms. Daily life and social customs Zambians still value traditional communal ideals such as reciprocity within a household, the extended family, the neighbourhood, the clan, and a formal political system of chieftainship. Changes in the modern arena have been too uneven to reduce Zambians dependence on one another, so they often exercise umucinshi, a Bemba term for mutual respect, when negotiating favours. As a predominantly Christian country, Zambia marks the celebration of the Christian holidays of Good Friday, Easter, and Christmas. Independence Day is observed on October 24, and a variety of other holidayssuch as Youth Day, Heroes Day, Unity Day, and Farmers Daytake place throughout the year. Additional feasts and festivals unique to various ethnic groups are also celebrated. The arts Traditional Zambian art consists chiefly of wood carving (most often practiced by men), pottery making (usually practiced by women), and basket weaving (practiced by both genders). Among musical instruments, drums are the most widely used, but there also are stringed bows, flutes, horns and pipes, xylophones, bells, rattles, and the kalimba, or African piano, made of strips of steel attached to a small board and vibrated by the fingers. Music, dancing, and song are used in tribal rituals and celebrations and are connected with good health, prosperity and security, or with the cycle of birth, marriage, and death. Music, as in many other countries, is used for entertainment as well and varies in form among ethnic groups. Various types of theatre have flourished. In the last years of colonial rule, dance drama was developed for nationalist ends; the Chikwakwa Theatre, based at the University of Zambia, pioneered politically radical popular drama in the early years of independence. In the 1980s, aid agencies and other bodies promoted theatre for development, often unscripted and in vernacular languages, and government departments have used drama to communicate agricultural and health messages. Cultural institutions There is a national museum at Livingstone and another in Ndola, on the Copperbelt. The Moto Moto Museum at Mbala focuses on the traditions of the Bemba people, and there are small field museums at some national monuments. The countrys national archives are located at Lusaka, and there are public libraries located in Kitwe and Ndola. Relics of the countrys past are the concern of the Commission for the Preservation of Natural and Historical Monuments and Relics. The National Dance Troupe performs the traditional dances of many groups. In 2005 the Gule Wamkulua ritual dance performed at initiation ceremonies, funerals, and other important occasionsand the Vimbuza Healing Dance were both designated UNESCO Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. "},{"CountryName":"Zimbabwe","CulturalInfo":" Cultural life The most famous of Rhodesian-bred writers, Doris Lessing, settled in England in 1949. In some contrast, the nationalist struggle prompted a renaissance of Shona culture. A forerunner of this renaissance (and a victim of the liberation struggle) was Herbert Chitepo, both as abstract painter and epic poet. Stanlake Samkanges novels reconstruct the Shona and Ndebele world of the 1890s, while those of the much younger Charles Mungoshi explore the clash of Shona and Western cultures in both the Shona and English languages. Folk traditions have survived in dance and pottery. The revival of sculpture has drawn on tribal religion and totems to produce some remarkable works, particularly those of Takawira and the Tengenenge school of craftsmen who sculpt in hard serpentine. Clyde William Sanger The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica   History  This discussion mainly focuses on the history of Zimbabwe since the late 15th century. For treatment of earlier periods and of the country in its regional context, see Southern Africa.  Great ZimbabweAerial view of the ruins of Great Zimbabwe.(more)The remains of Stone Age cultures dating to 500,000 years ago have been found in Zimbabwe, and it is thought that the San, who still survive mostly in the Kalahari desert of Botswana, are the last descendants of these original inhabitants of southern and central Africa. They were driven into the desert by Bantu-speaking groups during the long migrations from the north in the course of which the Bantu-speaking peoples populated much of Africa from Lake Chad to present-day South Africa. The first Bantu are thought to have reached Zimbabwe between the 5th and 10th centuries ce. Zimbabwe is home to many stone ruins, including those known as Great Zimbabwe (designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986). Some ruins date from about the 9th century, although the most elaborate belong to a period after the 15th century and are of Bantu origin.  Portuguese exploration The Portuguese, who arrived on the east coast of Africa at the end of the 15th century, dreamed of opening up the interior and establishing a route to connect their eastern settlements with Angola in the west. The first European to enter Zimbabwe was probably Antnio Fernandes, who tried to cross the continent and reached the neighbourhood of Que Que (now Kwekwe). Nearly 50 years later the Mwene Matapa (emperor), Negomo Chirisamhuru Mupunsagutu, was baptized by a Jesuit father, and in 1569 an abortive Portuguese military expedition entered the interior in search of gold. principal peoples of Southern Africa, 17th to mid-19th centuryMap showing the approximate locations of the principal peoples of Southern Africa from the 17th to the mid-19th century.(more)A second great movement of the Bantu peoples began in 1830, this time from the south. To escape from the power of the great Zulu chief Shaka, three important groups fled northward. One of them, the Ndebele, carved out a kingdom. The Ndebele were warriors and pastoralists, in the Zulu tradition, and under their formidable chief Mzilikazi they mastered and dispossessed the weaker tribes, known collectively as Shona (Mashona), who were sedentary, peaceful tillers of the land. For more than half a century, until the coming of European rule, the Ndebele continued to enslave and plunder the Shona. During this period, however, British and Afrikaner hunters, traders, and prospectors had begun to move up from the south, and with them came the missionaries. Robert Moffat visited Mzilikazi in 1857, and this meeting led to the establishment in 1861 of the first mission to the Ndebele by the London Missionary Society.

The British monarch is nominal head of state, represented by a governor-general. The constitution allows for a two-chamber legislature, consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives. Executive power is vested in a Council of Ministers headed by the prime minister, who is the head of government. Primary and postprimary education is compulsory."},{"CountryName":"Bahrain","CulturalInfo":"Bahrain’s island location has made it unique among Persian Gulf states. With greater access to ocean travel and broader exposure to outside influences, Bahrain traditionally has been home to a more ethnically and religiously diverse and cosmopolitan population than have other, more insular gulf states. This openness is reflected in Bahrain’s social customs, which—although still conservative—are much more moderate and relaxed than those of its neighbours, particularly conservative Saudi Arabia. Thus, although Bahrain is still at heart an Arab-Islamic country, it has been more accepting of modernization and Westernization than many of its neighbours.Daily life and social customsThe official holidays in Bahrain are generally the same as those observed in most Muslim countries. These include the two festivals, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday, and, more recently, the celebration of ʿĀshūrā among the country’s Shiʿis.Western-style clothing is common in Bahrain, though some men still wear the traditional thawb (full-length tunic) and the kaffiyeh (white head cloth), bound in place by a black, camel-hair cord known as an ʿiqāl—the latter often more ornate, particularly among the political elite. The dress rules for women are relaxed compared to the more conservative, regional standards, although women in rural areas, and those in conservative communities in cities, still wear the veil (ḥijab) and a traditional long cloak known as an ʿabāyah.Coffee is an important part of social life. Coffee shops are popular meeting places, and coffee is offered as a sign of hospitality. It is often flavoured with cardamom and saffron. Bahraini cuisine typically features fish, shrimp, meat, rice, and dates. Machbous is a popular traditional dish of fish or meat served with rice. Other typical food includes muḥammar, sweet brown rice with sugar or dates, and shāwarmah, spit-roasted lamb, beef, or chicken.The artsBahrain: dhow constructionA dhow under construction in a boatyard on the coast of Bahrain.Traditional handicraft industries receive state and popular support, and most villages practice specialized traditions; ʿĀlī, for example, is well known for its ceramics, while artists in Karbābād weave baskets from date-palm leaves. Throughout the country artisans engage in gold working, tinsmithing, and textile making and sell their wares at small shops or the Souk al-Arabaʿāʾ (“Wednesday Market”) in Manama. Shipyards at Manama and Al-Muḥarraq are sites of dhow building, a highly respected art form. The museum in Manama contains local artifacts dating from antiquity, such as ivory figurines, pottery, copper articles, and gold rings, many of which reflect various cultural influences from outside Bahrain. There is also a small but flourishing avant-garde art community.Music is an important part of Bahraini life. There is a rich folk music culture, and fidjeri, songs once sung by pearl divers, are still heard. Since 1991 the country has held an annual music festival. Although the country does not have a film industry, moviegoing is a popular activity, and some of Bahrain’s cinema theatres screen English-language films. In the early 21st century the government undertook a program to encourage the development of theatre.Cultural institutionsBahrain has several museums, including the Bahrain National Museum and Beit al-Qurʾān, which houses a large collection of Qurʾāns, some dating to the 7th century. There are also museums devoted to the history of petroleum production and to pearl diving as well as several art galleries. The Bahraini Ministry of Education maintains a network of public libraries, the oldest of which, in Manama, opened in 1946. The emirate also maintains one of the principal wildlife conservation areas in the Persian Gulf region, Al-Areen Park, which harbours such indigenous mammals as the oryx and gazelle and is visited by many waterfowl species.Sports and recreationFootball (soccer) is the most popular modern sport, while horse racing remains a national pastime. More than 20 types of Arabian horses are bred on the islands, and races are held weekly on Bahrain island’s large racecourse, which seats some 10,000 spectators. Traditional sports such as falconry and gazelle and hare hunting are still practiced by wealthier Bahrainis, and camel racing is a popular public entertainment. The country first competed in the Summer Olympic Games in 1984; it has not participated in the Winter Games.Media and publishingSeveral weekly and daily papers are published in Arabic, and a small number appear in English. Most of the press is privately owned and is not subject to censorship as long as it refrains from criticizing the ruling family. The state television and radio stations broadcast most programs in Arabic, although there are channels in English."},{"CountryName":"Central African Republic","CulturalInfo":"In most Central African families, women continue to play a crucial role in the gathering, production, conservation, distribution, and preparation of food. Hunting, trapping, and fishing—male occupations—remain important for the subsistence of many Central Africans, and women in some regions fish during the dry season. The production of such commercial crops as coffee, cotton, and tobacco tends to be chiefly a male activity, but women are the principal food producers for household consumption. Staple foods include cassava, rice, squash, pumpkins, and plantains, which are usually served with a sauce and grilled meat. Okra (gombo) figures in almost every meal, and peanuts and peanut butter appear in many dishes and add protein. Game is popular, as are the fish-based dishes called maboké and soussou. Beer, palm wine, and banana wine are made locally, and ginger beer is a popular soft drink.Churches are important in both rural and urban life, constituting major centres of not just religious activity but also social interaction. In addition to Sunday services, religious schools and various fellowship groups for women, men, adolescents, and children are common. Church members frequently gather after worship services for a ndoye (Sango: “gift”), a celebration with singing and dancing to honour a notable church member. Members bring food, soap, and kerosene to the honoree, who, in turn, serves coffee, tea, and a light snack.Holidays are also important in the Central African Republic. In addition to the big celebrations held for Christmas and New Year’s, December 1—known by various names, including National Day, Proclamation Day, and Republic Day—is important. This day commemorates the proclamation of the republic in 1958. Other holidays include Labour Day (May 1) and the anniversary of the death of President Barthélemy Boganda (March 29).The arts and cultural institutionsUntil the 19th century, artisans in the region produced many fine handmade items. The slave trade and the early years of colonization disrupted the expansion of crafts, however, and most of them disappeared. Today woven mats and baskets, simple wooden utensils, carved stools, pottery, and musical instruments, including the balafon (much like a xylophone but constructed of animal horns, skins, and wood), are all that remain of older handiwork. More recently, handicraft workers have begun producing unique designs and pictures made from butterfly wings glued to paper and some ebony and other tropical hardwood carvings. Drawing upon earlier traditions, contemporary artists are producing carvings of animals and people, and many are available in larger towns, as well as at Bangui’s artisans’ market.The Central African Republic is also home to remarkable displays of song and dance. The Aka of the southwestern forests have received international attention for their music and dance, and several troupes have traveled to Europe to perform. In Bangui and some regional towns, Central African musicians have formed such dance bands as Musiki, Zokela, Makembe, Cool Stars, Cannon Stars, and Super Stars. These musicians play their own unique version of electrified Congolese music, in which African rhythms and languages are combined with the rumba, cha-cha, and merengue. One Central African type of music, called Zokela, named after a band from the 1980s, has become a dynamic musical form associated with the Lobaye region. It melds elements of village ceremonies with contemporary urban sounds and has influenced many Bangui bands.Few works of literature from Central Africa have been published, but collectors still gather traditional oral legends and folk stories from older villagers. These histories and tales, some dating to the 19th century, remain a rich reserve of historical and cultural identity. The storytellers grip their listeners with lively call-and-response songs and chants in their narratives, bringing together both young and old listeners.Makombo Bamboté, author of the novels Princesse Mandapu (1972) and Coup d’état Nègre (1987), is the country’s best-known writer. Other prominent Central African authors include Faustin-Albert Ipeko-Etomane, Cyriaque Yavoucko, Pierre Sammy-Mackfoy, and Gabriel Danzi. Notable in Central African film production is the work of Joseph Akouissonne, who directed Zo kwe zo (“A Human Being Is a Person”) and Les Dieux noirs du stade (“The Black Gods of the Stadium”). Central African artists have produced both watercolour and oil paintings. The murals and canvases of Jerome Ramedane depict scenes of African animal life, hunting parties, and daily village life. Similar works are often found on the walls of restaurants, bars, and other gathering places in Bangui and other towns.The Boganda Museum in Bangui exhibits traditional musical instruments, implements of warfare, village architecture, hunting tools, pottery, and religious objects. Other attractions include the Bangui zoo and the city’s red-brick cathedral.Sports and recreationFootball (soccer) is the most popular recreational pastime for young Central Africans. Even the smallest village usually has a football field, and villages, churches, and schools often sponsor teams for both boys and girls. Both men’s and women’s teams have taken part in international competitions. Basketball and rugby are also widely played, especially in Bangui. Central African athletes have participated in the Olympic Games since 1968.Media and publishingRadio is by far the most important means of mass communication in the country, and the government owns and controls the major radio and television stations. The national radio system broadcasts international, national, and regional news throughout the country, but the national television system is limited mainly to the Bangui district. In addition, Africa Number One, a private radio station that is part of a French-owned network based in Gabon, has operated in Bangui since 1995, as has a station affiliated with the Roman Catholic church. Since 1997 Radio France Internationale has been operating in the country. Radio-MINURCA began broadcasting in 1998 as the radio station for UN peacekeeping forces, but in 2000, after the peacekeeping mission ended, it became Radio Ndeke Luka.The nation’s first daily newspaper, the state-run E Le Songo, began publication in 1986. Several private daily and weekly newspapers are published, some of which criticize the president and the government. The country’s main publications include Le Novateur, Le Citoyen, and L’Echo de Centrafrique."},{"CountryName":"Democratic-Republic-of-the-Congo","CulturalInfo":"Holidays celebrated in Congo include Commemoration of the Martyrs of Independence, observed on January 4; Labour Day and National Liberation Day, celebrated on May 1 and May 17, respectively; Independence Day, celebrated on June 30; Parents’ Day, celebrated on August 1; Youth Day, observed on October 14; Army Day and the Anniversary of the Second Republic, observed on November 17 and November 24, respectively; and Christmas, celebrated on December 25.The arts of the Democratic Republic of the CongoKuba mashamboy mask of fibre, shells, and beads, from the Kuba cultural area; in the Hampton University Museum, Virginia.Luba ancestral statueFemale Luba ancestral statue of carved wood; in the Musée de l'Homme, Paris.Lega carved ivory figureLega carved ivory figure, Democratic Republic of the Congo; in the Carlo Monzino Collection.Congo’s many ethnic groups and regions have developed a mosaic of traditional arts, including painting, sculpture, music, and dance. There has been a tendency to classify sculpture and carving according to the styles of the areas from which they originate. The southwest is known for the stone and nail-studded nkisi statues of the Kongo people and the masks and figurines of the Yaka. The Kuba, from the south-central region, are known for ndop, statues created in the likeness of the king that can serve as a symbolic representative in his absence. . Luba art dominates the southeast region and reflects the strong influence of women in society through statuettes depicting motherhood. North of the Luba, the Lega produce masks and ivories. Zande and Mangbetu art are included in the northern region. Zande art is characterized by cult statuettes, spear or bow shafts, and anthropomorphic pottery, while Mangbetu art features figures with stylized elongated heads. Other folk traditions include making pottery, weaving raffia, and creating ceremonial dress.Several contemporary Congolese authors have received international acclaim, including the poets Clémentine Madiya Faik-Nzuji, Kama Kamanda, and Ikole Botuli-Bolumbu; the playwright Ntumb Diur; and the novelists Timothée Malembe and Paul Désiré-Joseph Basembe. The collection and conservation of traditional oral literatures also has been important, and folklorists and ethnographers have produced anthologies of tales from the Mbuti Pygmies of the Ituri rainforest, proverbs from the Teke, tall tales from the Ngbaka, and other genres of traditional expression.Music is by far the art form for which Congo is best known. Kinshasa is widely regarded as one of the great music centres of the world, and the influence of Congolese music is felt especially throughout sub-Saharan Africa. In the 1950s musicians playing in nightclubs in the Matonge quarter of Kinshasa, foremost among them Kabesele Tshamala and François Lwambo, forged a style called African jazz (or OK jazz), a style that went on to influence contemporary musicians around the continent—and in Europe and North America as well. The rumba and soukous styles became popular in the 1960s, with performers such as Papa Wemba and the Grand Zaïko Orchestra eventually earning worldwide followings. Coupled with their sound were new dance steps such as the cavacha and silauka, which were widely adapted throughout Africa. The country’s most revered musical figure is Papa Wendo (Wendo Kolosoy; 1925–2008), a singer and musician who helped lay the foundations of Congolese rumba and whose career spanned seven decades. He was coaxed out of retirement in the late 1990s when African-music enthusiasts rediscovered his 1955 hit “Marie Louise” and urged him to perform again. He later appeared with his group, the Victoria Bakolo Miziki Orchestra, at festivals throughout Africa and Europe. The most popular indigenous musical style today is a blend of Cuban merengue, Congolese rumba, and West African highlife sounds, reflecting the many influences that meet in Congo.Cultural institutionsThe cities, especially Kinshasa, are the greatest creators, propagators, and promoters of national cultural life and arts. The Academy of Fine Arts in Kinshasa offers training programs in painting, sculpture, carving, architecture, and ceramics. The National Institute of the Arts offers training in classical as well as traditional music and drama. Congolese authors write poetry, plays, and novels in French, Lingala, or local languages.There are museums and public libraries in most large cities, with national museums in Kananga, Mbandaka, and Lubumbashi. The capital city houses the national archives and the National Theatrical Troupe. There are libraries at each of the universities as well.Sports and recreationIn precolonial times, the people who lived along the Congo River enjoyed a number of games and sports that drew competitors from far afield. These included riverboat racing, which was conducted in long, low dugout canoes, each powered by two dozen rowers who achieved great speeds; short- and long-distance running; and wrestling, at which the Congolese continue to excel. The missionaries who closely followed the first Europeans into the region introduced volleyball, basketball, and football (soccer), all of which have remained popular in postcolonial times, especially football.Congo’s tradition of excellence in football dates to the early years of the 20th century, when a Roman Catholic school in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) organized the country’s first team. Raphael de la Kethule, a schoolboy at the time, went on to found the capital’s first sports association and to build its first stadium in 1937. (In 1974 that stadium was the site of a famed heavyweight championship fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman known popularly as the “Rumble in the Jungle.”) Kethule’s association, which soon numbered dozens of clubs, grew to include not only football but also gymnastics, swimming, water polo, and tennis. With that firm grounding, Congolese football teams went on to win the African Nations Cup in 1968 and 1974. Congolese basketball teams have earned similar honors, winning several Central African Cup prizes.Congo organized its national Olympic committee in 1963 and was recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1968. It sent a team to the 1968 Mexico City Games but did not participate in another Olympiad until the 1984 Los Angeles Games, where it competed under the name Zaire.Media and publishingRadio is the primary media format in Congo; there are numerous private and public stations, several of which—including Radio-Télévision Nationale Congolaise (RTNC), which is state run—broadcast throughout the country. In addition to RTNC’s television programming, a number of private television stations are also in operation. Publications include dailies such as Elima, Le Phare, and Le Potential, as well as Mwana Shaba (a Gécamines publication) and L’Aurore Protestante (a religious publication), which are issued monthly. Several publishing houses have been established throughout the country."},{"CountryName":"Republic of the Congo","CulturalInfo":"Precolonial artistic expression emphasized ceremonial music, dance, sculpture, and oral literature. Christianity and colonialism had a great impact on these art forms. The carving of ritual objects became commercialized, and music and dance altered as a result of the introduction of Western instruments and musical styles. In the 1980s the Brazzaville region, along with Kinshasa, across the river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, became a vital centre for the production of contemporary African music, known as Congolese music or rumba. The genre, which mixes traditional African rhythms and instruments with those borrowed from other cultures, enjoys widespread popularity throughout Africa as well as around the world.Holidays observed in Congo include those celebrated by Christians around the world, such as Good Friday, Easter, and Christmas. Labour Day and Independence Day are observed on May 1 and August 15, respectively. There are a number of libraries in Brazzaville, including the national library. The Marien Ngouabi Museum in Brazzaville has an excellent collection of indigenous masks from groups throughout the Congo River basin, particularly those of the Kongo people, who trace their ancestry back to the Kongo kingdom that ruled parts of both modern-day Congo and Angola.Sports and recreationFootball (soccer) is very popular in Congo. The Congolese Football Federation was founded in 1962 and affiliated with the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) that same year. The men’s national team, nicknamed the Diables Rouges (“Red Devils”), won the opening African Games tournament at home in 1965 and won their first African Cup of Nations in 1972. Besides football, men’s and women’s basketball and women’s volleyball are popular. Congo first competed in the Olympic Games at the 1964 Tokyo Games.Media and publishingRadio and television programs are broadcast on both state-owned and private stations in a variety of languages. The majority of Congolese receive their news through broadcast media and, in rural areas, particularly by means of state-run radio. Although the constitution provides for freedom of speech, some actions, including those that incite ethnic strife or civil war, are punishable by law. Both the government-owned and private broadcast media tend to be pro-government, and journalists often practice self-censorship.The majority of print media are circulated in the urban centres of Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire. Important periodicals include the French-language weeklies Le Choc, Les Echos du Congo (pro-government), L’Observateur (independent), and Le Semaine Africaine (Roman Catholic)."},{"CountryName":"Côte d’Ivoire","CulturalInfo":"The cultural milieu has remained split, rather more completely than in other African countries, between a maze of ethnic-based cultures and a foreign intrusion that is almost exclusively French. Traditional arts flourish. The Senufo carve masks, decorate doors with esoteric symbols, and dance to the slow, majestic rhythms of drums supported by xylophones. The mountaineers of the Man forest wear masks showing horrifying faces, and they dance to a pace governed by the sound of drums and led by stilt-walkers. Versatile Baule artists make fine gold jewelry and wooden sculptures.The arts of Côte d’IvoireIvoirian literature in French was born in colonial times at the Ponty High School in Dakar, Senegal. One of its graduates, Bernard B. Dadié, became world-famous for autobiographical reminiscences in novel form. His schoolmates Coffi Gadeau and Amon d’Aby won a large local audience and many followers through their plays for the national theatre. A younger playwright, Zadi Zaourou, launched a chair in African literature at an Ivoirian university, and Ahmadou Kourouma, a Muslim, inaugurated a new era of the Ivoirian novel with Les Soleils des indépendances (1968; “The Suns of Independence”), first published in Canada. Ake Loba is another well-known writer from the country.Music is a vital part of Ivoirian culture. There is a strong tradition of griots who use music to help tell historical stories. The Senufo use marimbas and tuned iron gongs, among other instruments, to make their music. Music that combines both African and European traditions also exists. Alpha Blondy, who is strongly influenced by reggae, is Côte d’Ivoire’s most internationally known musician.Jean L. ComhaireCultural institutionsThe national library is located in Abidjan, as is a museum that houses a variety of artistic, ethnographic, and scientific collections. As the country’s largest city, Abidjan also has an active nightlife and is known as the Paris of Africa. The Hotel Ivoire, which contains an ice-skating rink, a swimming pool, a bowling alley, a movie theatre, and other attractions, is located there. Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro Basilica, which resembles St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, was built by former president Felix Houphouët-Boigny in Yamoussoukro, his hometown; upon completion in 1989, it was the largest Christian church in the world.Sports and recreationAs in many other African countries, football (soccer) is a major sport in Côte d’Ivoire. A football field exists in just about every town and village, and there is at least one football club in every city. Côte d’Ivoire also has a baseball federation, and many Ivoirians play basketball and rugby. Tennis attracts a number of athletes, and the country has competed in the international Davis Cup tournament. The country made its Olympic debut at the 1964 Games in Tokyo, and it first entered the African Nations Cup in 1965. Gabriel Tiacoh was the first Ivoirian to win an Olympic medal when he won a silver medal in the men’s 400-metre race at the 1984 Games held in Los Angeles.Media and publishingAlthough freedom of the press is guaranteed under the constitution, in reality it is restricted. Still, the press consists of many daily papers, weeklies, and periodicals, and this sector has become more lively since the 1990s. Almost all publications are published in French in Abidjan. Radio is the most prevalent media form throughout the country. Several radio stations exist, and they broadcast programs in French as well as in African languages. There is also a state-run television station; international television programming is available via satellite."},{"CountryName":"Fiji","CulturalInfo":"Fiji’s mixed ethnicity contributes to a rich cultural heritage. Many features of traditional Fijian life survive; they are most evident in the elaborate investiture, marriage, and other ceremonies for high-ranking chiefs. Those ceremonies provide a focus for the practicing of traditional crafts, such as the manufacture of masi, or tapa cloth, made from the bark of the paper mulberry; mat weaving; wood carving; and canoe making. Drinking of yanggona (kava, made from the root of Piper methysticum) takes place not only as a part of important ceremonies but also as a part of the everyday life of Fijians and Indians alike.The Indians of Fiji continue to maintain their own culture. Traditional marriage ceremonies are practiced, as are customs such as fire walking and ritual self-torture during the annual Guru Purnima festival, at the time of the full moon in July or early August. Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, is celebrated every October as a public holiday.The arts and cultural institutionsDisplays of “traditional” Fijian culture, music, and dancing make an important contribution to tourism; model villages and handicraft markets are popular with tourists. A traditional song-and-dance performance, the meke, is rooted in storytelling traditions. In its strictest form, the meke involves chanting by shamans, whose bodies take on spirits of the netherworld, accompanied by dancing, rhythmic clapping, and the beating of slit drums. The meke is one of the traditional performances at the Arts Village, a model community and tourist centre near Deuba. Cinemas showing imported Indian films are popular. The Fiji Museum, located in the Thurston Botanical Gardens in Suva, contains a fine collection of war canoes and other artifacts.Sports and recreationIn general, sports in Fiji can be divided into pursuits traditionally enjoyed by the local peoples and activities offered chiefly to visitors. In the latter category are scuba diving and snorkeling, surfing, windsurfing, and rafting. Among the authentic Fijian sports activities are women’s canoe races on Rotuma Island, wrestling, and disk pitching, a Polynesian-Melanesian form of shuffleboard. The bilibili, a wooden raft, is traditionally used to traverse low-grade white-water rivers. There is also a long tradition of outrigger canoeing in Fiji, and it continues to play an important role in the country’s culture.Rugby is very popular among native Fijians, and the islands supply players to the top leagues in the world. The national team has performed well in international competition. Other popular sports include football (soccer), lawn bowls, cricket, and basketball. The Fiji Bula Marathon is held each year in May or June. The Fiji National Olympic Committee was formed in 1949, and Fiji has participated in the Summer Olympic Games since 1956.Media and publishingFiji has several daily newspapers, and there are also weekly and monthly publications. There are a multilingual public radio broadcasting system and several private multilingual radio stations. A commercial television station provides free services and several pay channels."},{"CountryName":"Georgia","CulturalInfo":"Cultural lifeThe Georgians are a proud people with an ancient culture. They have through the ages been noted as warriors as well as for their hospitality, love of life, lively intelligence, sense of humour, and reputed longevity (although statistical data does not support this latter assertion).Georgia has a literary tradition that dates to the 5th century CE. Kolkhida (Colchis) early housed a school of higher rhetoric in which Greeks as well as Georgians studied. By the 12th century, academies in Ikalto and Gelati, the first medieval higher-education centres, disseminated a wide range of knowledge. The national genius was demonstrated most clearly in Vepkhis-tqarsani (The Knight in the Panther’s Skin), the epic masterpiece of the 12th-century poet Shota Rustaveli. Major figures in later Georgian literary history include a famed 18th-century writer, Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani, and the novelist, poet, and dramatist Ilia Chavchavadze. The 19th-century playwright Giorgi Eristavi is regarded as the founder of the modern Georgian theatre. Among other prominent prerevolutionary authors were the lyric poet Akaki Tsereteli; Alexander Qazbegi, novelist of the Caucasus; and the nature poet Vazha Pshavela. The novelist Mikhail Javakhishvili and the poet Titsian Tabidze were executed during the Stalin era, and the poet Paolo Iashvili was censured by the government and committed suicide. Giorgi Leonidze and Galaktion Tabidze were well-known poets, and Konstantin Gamsakhurdia was celebrated for his historical novels.The Abkhazian literary tradition dates back only to the late 19th century. Notable writers include the poet, novelist, and scholar Dmitri Gulia, the novelist and playwright Samson Chanba, the poet Bagrat Shinkuba, and Fazil Iskander, a popular satirist who writes in Russian.Important individuals in other arts include the painters Niko Pirosmani (Pirosmanashvili), Irakli Toidze, Lado Gudiashvili, Elena Akhvlediani, and Sergo Kobuladze; the composers Zakaria Paliashvili and Meliton Balanchivadze (father of the choreographer George Balanchine); and the founder of Georgian ballet, Vakhtang Chabukiani. Georgian theatre, in which outstanding directors of the Soviet period were Kote Mardzhanishvili, Sandro Akhmeteli, and Robert Sturm, has had a marked influence in Europe and elsewhere. The Georgian film Repentance, an allegory about the repressions of the Stalin era, was directed by Tenghiz Abuladze. It won the Special Jury Prize at the 1987 Cannes film festival and was widely praised for its political courage.The ancient culture of the republic is reflected in the large number of architectural monuments, including many monasteries and churches; indeed, Georgian architecture (with Armenian) played a considerable role in the development of the Byzantine style.Georgia has a long tradition of fine metalwork. Bronze, gold, and silver objects of a high technical and aesthetic standard have been recovered from tombs of the 1st and 2nd millennia BCE. Between the 10th and 13th centuries CE, Georgian goldsmiths produced masterpieces of cloisonné enamel and repoussé work, notably icons, crosses, and jewelry.A number of newspapers and periodicals are published, most of them in Georgian. Radio programs are broadcast in Georgian and in several minority languages, and television programs are broadcast in Georgian and Russian."},{"CountryName":"Kosovo","CulturalInfo":"The cultural lives of Kosovo’s Albanians and Serbs, although distinctive, bear many resemblances to those of the peoples of Albania and Serbia, respectively. For further information on the cultures of those countries, see Albania: Cultural life and Serbia: Cultural life.Cultural milieuTraditional Kosovar society, for both Albanians and Serbs, has an important patriarchal tradition, with extended family members often living together in large groups. Family support networks remain very strong, even when some members live outside the country. Most business connections are made through these networks.Reflecting Albanian customary law, blood feuds between families were a fairly common occurrence—especially in western Kosovo—until the 1990s, when University of Pristina professor Anton Çetta and other activists led an antivendetta campaign. The practice resurfaced, however, amid the political instability following the 1998–99 conflict.Daily life and social customsIn Kosovo’s largely secular society, most people dress in Western clothing. Although Muslim women and girls generally do not wear head scarves, in 2009 the ministry of education banned them from schools, arousing controversy. Many older Albanian men still wear a traditional brimless white cap, or plis. For weddings, full traditional dress often is worn, particularly by women; these garments may be embroidered with silver.Among the most popular traditional Albanian dishes are fli, a dish of pancakelike pastry layered with cream and yogurt, and pite, a phyllo pastry with cheese, meat, or vegetable filling. A distinctive dish is llokuma (sometimes translated as “wedding doughnuts”), deep-fried dough puffs eaten with yogurt and garlic or with honey. Baklava is the most common sweet to serve for special occasions.Many of Kosovo’s seasonal rites originated in pagan times, and some later were integrated with the Christian and Islamic faiths. For instance, both Orthodox Christians and Muslims burn a Yule log about the time of the winter solstice. For Orthodox Christians, it is a Christmas Eve tradition (celebrated on January 6, according to the Orthodox liturgical calendar). For Muslims the log is known as the buzm. In the Orthodox community, Christmas is surpassed in significance by Easter. Among Muslims, Ramadan is the most important celebration. A popular springtime holiday, St. George’s Day (Albanian: Shëngjergji), is celebrated by members of all faiths. In fall, Kosovar Albanians observe Thanksgiving Day (Darka e Lamës).The artsHeroic epics and ballads as well as oral prose traditionally played an important part in relaying the history and myths associated with the ethnic groups of Kosovo. Recitation often was accompanied by the sounds of traditional instruments—such as the single-stringed gusla (Albanian: lahuta; Serbian: gusle) or, among Albanians, the larger two-stringed çifteli. These stories and songs remain important underpinnings of ethnic identity for both Albanians and Serbs. Traditional dances, often circle dances, are still performed as well, often by single-sex groups.One of the earliest examples of art identified within Kosovo is a 6,000-year-old small terra-cotta figure known as the Goddess on the Throne. Discovered near Pristina in the mid-20th century, it serves as a symbol of Kosovo. Kosovo is rich in folk art dating from the more recent past as well. Snake symbols are a common feature of Albanian architecture and decoration, and a pagan belief that snakes protect households survives to the present day. One of the best-known Kosovar artists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries is Sokol Beqiri, whose works include provocative photography, video, and performance pieces.In the late 19th century, especially after the founding of the Albanian League (the first Albanian nationalist organization; also called the League of Prizren) in 1878, a number of Albanian literary figures advocated for independence from the Ottoman Empire. However, there was relatively little written literature in the Albanian language until the 20th century. Albanian literature in Kosovo proceeded to develop differently than it did in Albania, where the communist government imposed more severe ideological constraints. Among the best-known Kosovar Albanian writers of the 20th and 21st centuries are the novelist, playwright, and poet Eqrem Basha; the poet and critic Sabri Hamiti; the poet Ali Podrimja; the scholar, novelist, and political figure Rexhep Qosja; the novelist Zejnullah Rrahmani; the poet Azem Shkreli; and the poet, doctor, and political activist Flora Brovina, who gained renown during her imprisonment by Yugoslav authorities in 1999–2000. Among Kosovar Serb writers, the 20th-century novelist and literary critic Vukašin Filipović was respected by the Albanian and Serb communities alike.In the years following the 1998–99 conflict, Kosovo’s young population helped to revive the arts scene. Pristina in particular became a vibrant centre for art, drama, and music. Folk, classical, and contemporary popular music thrived.Cultural institutionsGračanica MonasteryGračanica (Graçanica) Monastery, completed c. 1321, Kosovo.Among Kosovo’s most significant historic sites are the medieval Serbian Orthodox monasteries of Dečani (Albanian: Deçan), Gračanica (Graçanica; near Pristina), and Peć (Pejë), as well as the Church of the Virgin of Ljeviša (near Prizren). In 2004 the Dečani monastery was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site; the others were inscribed in 2006. Two of the oldest Muslim sites are the 15th-century Çarshia and Mbretit (Fatih) mosques in Pristina. During the 1998–99 conflict, dozens of Muslim sites were destroyed, including the 18th-century Red Mosque in Pejë and the Ottoman-era bazaar in Gjakovë (Ðakovica). Following the conflict, revenge attacks damaged or destroyed a number of Orthodox churches, although the World Heritage sites survived.Pristina: Kosovo MuseumKosovo Museum, Pristina, Kosovo.Pristina is home to the Kosovo Museum (2002), the Academy of Sciences and Arts (1975), and the National Theatre (1946; originally located in Prizren). Construction of an opera house, named after the pre-independence Kosovar Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, began in the capital in 2009. Many of Kosovo’s cultural and archaeological artifacts remain in Belgrade, Serb., where they were taken prior to the 1998–99 conflict.Sports and recreationSkiing, football (soccer), basketball, wrestling, table tennis, and judo are among the sports popular in Kosovo. However, because Kosovo’s independence was not universally recognized, the International Olympic Committee and a number of other international sports organizations denied Kosovar applications for membership. In the early 21st century, ski resorts were under repair following years of neglect and war damage. Kosovo created a network of protected natural areas, including Sharr Mountains National Park, located along the border with North Macedonia.Media and publishingFreedom of the press was enshrined in the 2008 constitution. The publicly funded broadcaster Radio Television Kosovo provides television and radio programming, primarily in the Albanian language. There are also a number of privately owned television and radio broadcasters. The major newspaper is the Albanian-language Koha Ditore (“The Daily Times”); other Albanian publications include Zëri (“The Voice”), Kosova Sot (“Kosovo Today”), and Epoka e Re (“The New Epoch”). The Serb community relies on Serbian-language media from local outlets as well as from Serbia."},{"CountryName":"Federated States of Micronesia","CulturalInfo":"Although only the people of Yap and a few outlying atolls in Chuuk still wear traditional dress—loincloths for men and grass skirts or lavalavas (sarongs) for women—most villagers live much as their ancestors did. In rural areas they support themselves by subsistence farming and fishing, use traditional food-preparation techniques, and gather in community meetinghouses for ceremonies and leisure activities, although imported foods and ways of life have made their way into even the most remote areas. Boatbuilders in some of the remote atolls and islands, such as Satawal in Yap state, have maintained their skills in the construction and navigation of large single outrigger canoes. The seamanship of the islanders is probably their most remarkable achievement and has astonished Westerners since initial contact. Wood carving, originally practiced for religious purposes, has become a commercial enterprise. Women in some of the islands weave lavalavas on traditional belt looms, and nearly everywhere large sleeping mats are plaited of pandanus leaves. Tattooing, once used widely to indicate social status, is seldom practiced today. The traditional dances remain a favourite form of entertainment. For information on the arts of Micronesia in a regional context, see Oceanic art and architecture."},{"CountryName":"Saint Kitts and Nevis","CulturalInfo":"Christopher Columbus visited Saint Kitts on his second voyage in 1493 and found it inhabited by Carib people. He named it Saint Christopher for his patron saint. The name was shortened to Saint Kitts by settlers under Sir Thomas Warner, who, arriving from England in 1623, established the first successful English colony in the West Indies at Old Road on the west coast. The French first arrived on the island in 1625 and established a colony of their own in 1627 under Pierre Bélain, sieur d’Esnambuc. Divided during the 17th century between warring French and English colonists, Saint Kitts was given to Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht of April 1713 and remained in British possession despite the capture in 1782 of Brimstone Hill by the French. The island was restored to Great Britain by the Peace of Paris treaty signed by Britain and France at Versailles in 1783.Nevis was also sighted by Columbus in 1493. The island’s name derives from Columbus’s description of the clouds atop Nevis Peak as las nieves, or “the snows,” when he sighted the island. It was settled by the English in 1628 and soon became one of the most prosperous of the Antilles. Although it suffered from French and Spanish attacks in the 17th and 18th centuries, it maintained a sound economic position until the mid-19th century.Federation and independence movementsThe islands of Saint Kitts, Nevis, and Anguilla were united by federal act in 1882 and became an independent state in association with the United Kingdom on February 27, 1967. The islands were granted full internal self-government, with the United Kingdom retaining responsibility for defense and foreign affairs.After the islands had assumed the status of associated states, Anguilla complained of domination by the Saint Kitts administration. In May 1967 the Anguillans ejected the Saint Kitts police and established their own council. In July of the same year, they proclaimed their independence. After unsuccessful negotiations, the Anguilla Act of July 1971 placed Anguilla directly under British control. On February 10, 1976, Anguilla was granted a constitution, and its union with Saint Kitts and Nevis was formally severed in 1980.A constitutional conference was held in London in 1982, and, in spite of disagreement over special provisions for Nevis, Saint Kitts and Nevis became independent on September 19, 1983. A drop in world sugar prices hurt the nation’s economy through the mid-1980s, and the government sought to reduce the islands’ dependence on sugar production and to diversify the economy.Gladstone E.M. MillsJanet D. MomsenKennedy Simmonds, the first prime minister of the independent Saint Kitts and Nevis, remained in office until 1995, when his People’s Action Movement was defeated decisively by the Saint Kitts–Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP). One of the early issues in the administration of the new prime minister, SKNLP leader Denzil Douglas, was a secession movement on Nevis. A referendum was held there in 1998 on the question of independence for the island, but it fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to secede. The nationalized sugar industry continued to slump and, after years of operating it at a loss, the government closed it down after the 2005 harvest. Tourism and the hosting of offshore financial and service companies became the leading income producers in the country’s economy. Douglas won reelection in 2000, 2004, and 2010 but was defeated in 2015 by Team Unity, a coalition of opposition parties led by former foreign minister Timothy Harris, who became the new prime minister."},{"CountryName":"Saint Lucia","CulturalInfo":"The exact date of the European discovery of Saint Lucia is not known, but it is thought to have been about 1500. The first attempts at colonization were made by the English in 1605 and 1638, but they were frustrated by sickness and the hostility of the native Caribs. A successful settlement was achieved in 1650 by the French from Martinique, who made a treaty with the Caribs in 1660. In 1664 Thomas Warner, son of the governor of Saint Kitts, regained the island, but it was restored to France by the Treaty of Breda in 1667. In 1674 it was claimed by the crown of France and made a dependency of Martinique.Another British settlement under a grant made in 1722 by George I to the duke of Montague was frustrated by France, which had granted the island to Marshal d’Estrées in 1718, and the island was declared neutral. In 1743 the French resumed possession, retaining the island until the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, in which the two countries again agreed to regard Saint Lucia as neutral. In 1762 it was captured by Adm. George Rodney and Gen. Robert Monckton, only to be given up once more by the Treaty of Paris (1763). In 1778 it again surrendered to the British, who used its harbours as a naval base, but, by the Peace of Versailles, Saint Lucia was once more restored to France. Between 1782 and 1803 the possession of Saint Lucia passed several times between Britain and France, the British having to suppress a vigorous revolutionary party, which was aided by insurgent slaves, before gaining possession in 1803. Saint Lucia was finally ceded to Britain in 1814 by the Treaty of Paris, after which it became a crown colony. During 1838–85, together with the other islands of the Windward group, it was administered by the governor of Barbados.French influence on the development of Saint Lucia is illustrated by the dominance of the Roman Catholic Church and the survival of a French patois. In the years following 1763, French planters came from Saint Vincent and Grenada and established cotton and sugar plantations. In 1834, when the slaves were emancipated, there were in Saint Lucia more than 13,000 black slaves, 2,600 free blacks, and 2,300 whites. Prosperity was impeded by the decline of the sugarcane industry. Improvement came with the increase of banana and cacao cultivation and the revival of sugarcane.Independence of Saint LuciaRepresentative government was obtained by the constitution of 1924, which introduced an elective element into the legislative council; the constitution of 1936 provided for an unofficial majority in the council.In 1958 Saint Lucia joined the West Indies Federation, although its colonial status remained unchanged. Under the 1960 constitution the post of governor of the Windward Islands was abolished, and Saint Lucia became an autonomous unit within the federation, also achieving a greater degree of internal self-government. After the federation was dissolved on May 31, 1962, the status question was eventually settled by the West Indies Act of 1967, in which Saint Lucia assumed a status of association with the United Kingdom on March 1, 1967.Independence was finally achieved on February 22, 1979, with Saint Lucia remaining a parliamentary democracy within the Commonwealth. In the first elections following independence, the left-leaning Saint Lucia Labour Party (SLP) defeated the more conservative United Workers’ Party (UWP). The SLP governments favoured the socialist regimes of the Caribbean, establishing relations with Cuba and joining the nonaligned movement. They also helped form the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States in 1981.The SLP’s attempts at a mixed economy proved unable to deal with the staggering problems of the new country, especially after Hurricane Allen wiped out the banana crop in 1980. Rivalry within the party led to the resignation of two prime ministers in two years, and political instability caused the tourist trade to drop to one-half of its pre-independence level. In May 1982 the UWP was voted into power on a platform of inviting foreign investment and decentralizing government administration. The agricultural sector was gradually rebuilt after the hurricane, and the end of a recession in the United States increased tourism. The UWP retained power in elections held in 1987 and 1992."},{"CountryName":"Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","CulturalInfo":"Carnival is the major cultural event. The Nine Mornings Festival takes place in Kingstown in the nine mornings preceding Christmas. While traditionally it consisted of early-morning street parades accompanied by caroling, bicycle races, and other festivities, the focus now in Kingstown is on early-morning street concerts. In the rural areas, celebrations of this festival are more diverse and include attempts to revive dying cultural practices. Some of the Grenadine Islands have annual regattas that include carnival-type activities.Kingstown has a number of cultural heritage sites. They include the Botanical Gardens (founded in 1765) and Fort Charlotte (1806); of architectural interest is the Georgian-style St. George’s (Anglican) Cathedral. Other 18th- and 19th-century buildings include the courthouse and the House of Assembly, which occupy the same building, and the police barracks.Traditional cultural practices such as tea meetings (ceremonial speech and singing demonstrations) are occasionally held, and there has been some emphasis put on dance, drama, and music festivals. Calypso, soca (which blends traditional calypso and Indian rhythmic instruments), and Jamaican dancehall and reggae music tend to dominate the country’s music charts.The rise of individualism, economic independence, and migration have led to a decrease in the importance of the extended family. Women are increasingly involved in economic, political, and cultural life to a greater degree than was the case traditionally. Men and women have equal status under the law, and a government department of gender affairs is concerned with issues including gender equality and equal access to social, political, economic, and educational opportunities.With globalization, the demand for foreign foods has increased, and these are widely available in supermarkets. Growing awareness and concerns about health and nutrition are beginning to lead to a greater emphasis on local foods for consumption, however. The country’s markets are usually well stocked with fruits and vegetables. The national dish is roasted breadfruit and fried jackfish (jack); the fish are commonly caught locally, and breadfruit have been present on the island of Saint Vincent since 1793, when they were brought by Capt. William Bligh, the former commander of HMS Bounty.Sports and recreationSaint Vincent and the Grenadines are internationally renowned for the clarity and calm of their offshore leeward waters, which have lured countless yachtsmen, sailors, surfers, and scuba divers to the islands.Native Vincentians, however, favour land-based sports, especially cricket. The Arnos Vale Sports Complex, in Kingstown, has become a popular venue for one-day international cricket matches. Over the years, Vincentian cricketers have represented the West Indies in international cricket tournaments and have played professionally in England. Vincentians are equally fond of football (soccer); the national team has played in the Caribbean Cup and the Gold Cup world competition. The sport of netball has also produced a number of strong Vincentian national teams. Basketball and women’s cricket and football are gaining popularity.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines made its first appearance at the Olympics at the 1988 Seoul Games. Vincentian athletes compete and place regularly in the quadrennial Commonwealth Games.Media and publishingThe government runs a free public library system. Several weekly newspapers are published. Cable television service provides programs mainly from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and from North America. Local radio and television programming is provided by a government-owned broadcasting company in the capital. There are a number of private radio stations, including one affiliated with a political party and another that broadcasts religious programs."},{"CountryName":"Samoa","CulturalInfo":"Although some Samoan values and customs have changed markedly since European contact, particularly in Apia, Samoans have strived to preserve the fa‘a Samoa (“Samoan way of life”); thus, many traditions and outward features of rural life have remained virtually unchanged.Daily life and social customsVisit a traditional fale (open-sided house) on the island of Savai‘i, SamoaA visit to a fale (traditional open-sided house) on the island of Savai‘i, Samoa.See all videos for this articleMost Samoan villages have a church and a meetinghouse, which doubles as a cultural centre. Clustered around the village green are several fale—traditional oval-shaped houses with open sides and thatched or corrugated tin roofs supported by wooden pillars. Rolled palm-leaf mats can be let down at the sides of each house to offer protection from the elements. Many fale have been replaced by rectangular houses of timber or concrete blocks with walls and windows. Kitchens are often located in separate cookhouses.Typical foods, grown or caught locally, include taro, yams, breadfruit, fish, and shellfish. Chicken and pork dishes are also eaten. Imported foodstuffs have become increasingly common, including Asian rice, frozen meats, and packaged foods and beverages from other parts of the world. Kava, a traditional nonalcoholic, euphoria-producing drink, is prepared from a tropical pepper plant and consumed at social events, mainly by matai, who customarily pour a small amount on the ground before and after drinking. Related customs include sitting cross-legged in a home before addressing one’s host and refraining from eating while standing indoors or walking outdoors.The artsLearn about the traditional practice of Samoan tattooing at the Cultural Village in Apia, SamoaLearn about the traditional practice of Samoan tattooing at the Cultural Village in Apia, SamoaAn overview of traditional Samoan tattooing.See all videos for this articleMusic, dance, tattooing, and oral literature are significant art forms in Samoa. Males at age 12 or 13 visit a local tufuga (tattoo artist) for tattooing from waist to knee, a prolonged and often painful process that is considered a rite of passage. Christian missionaries in the 19th century, believing that tattooing was contrary to biblical teachings, eliminated the practice from many Polynesian islands, but Samoans maintained the tradition and helped revive it among Tahitians and other groups in the late 20th century. Few early works of siapo (bark cloth) art, basketry, and featherwork have survived, and handicrafts are now produced only in limited numbers.Music has always been central to Samoan life. Vocal music is predominant, both in religious services and social gatherings, and is accompanied by rhythmic percussion and wind instruments. Dances often presented for tourists include sāsā (a sitting dance performed mainly through arm movements) and fa‘ataupati (in which men rhythmically slap their limbs and torsos). Samoans often entertain one another at weddings and other family gatherings with ula, in which two groups alternate between singing and dancing. The pese is another popular song style.Oral literature in Samoa dates from earliest settlement. Genealogies, legends, chants, and spells have all been passed down and elaborated through the generations, and matai are still expected to deliver rhythmic and poetical orations at council meetings and other major events. Many of these traditions have been translated into written form since the 19th century. International acclaim has been garnered by some Samoan writers, including Albert Wendt, who has explored aspects of the fa‘a Samoa—including power struggles, social restrictions, and family relations—in works such as Pouliuli (1977) and The Birth and Death of the Miracle Man and Other Stories (1999).Cultural institutionsVisit Robert Louis Stevenson's house, now a museum, in Apia, SamoaA tour of the Robert Louis Stevenson Museum in Apia, Samoa.See all videos for this articleSamoa has few major cultural institutions apart from the School of Agriculture, Avele College, and the National University of Samoa. The Robert Louis Stevenson Museum (1990) and the Nelson Memorial Public Library (1959) are located in Apia.Sports and recreationThe main holidays include Independence Day (usually celebrated for three days: June 1–3), Christmas, and New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. Although Samoan music and dance styles remain popular, radio stations often broadcast imported Hawaiian and other Polynesian music, as well as rock. American and Chinese films, the latter with English subtitles, are commonly viewed.Rugby football is a popular sport among Samoans, who have long played for New Zealand and Samoan national teams. Australian Rules football is also increasingly popular. Entire communities sometimes play kirikiti, which is similar to cricket but involves teams of unrestricted size; games are social as well as sporting events, with spirited cheering and singing by spectators and unlimited food and drinks provided by the host village. Samoans and other Polynesians have used outrigger canoes since establishing their first island settlements. Most of the canoes are confined to lagoons, but many are also paddled in ocean races. Footracing, cockfighting, tiak (darts), and spear throwing are also traditional Samoan sports. Select groups participate in tennis, golf, bowling, and other competitions. Samoa has competed in the Olympic Games since 1984.Media and publishingThe country’s newspapers include The Samoa Observer, the Samoa News, Savali, and the Samoa Weekly; each has a limited circulation—from a few hundred to a few thousand copies. Samoa has three radio stations. Its first full-time television broadcaster began operating in 1993, offering locally produced programs and satellite transmissions from overseas. (For further discussion of Samoan cultural life, see Oceanic arts and Polynesian culture.)",{"CountryName":"San Marino","CulturalInfo":"The Republic of San Marino traces its origin to the early 4th century CE when, according to tradition, St. Marinus and a group of Christians settled there to escape persecution. The Castellum Sancta Marini is mentioned in the Liber Pontificalis (“The Book of the Pontiffs”) in 755; the oldest document in the republican archives mentions the abbot of San Marino in 885. By the 12th century San Marino had developed into a commune ruled by its own statutes and consuls. The commune was able to remain independent despite encroachments by neighbouring bishops and lords, largely because of its isolation and its mountain fortresses. Against the attacks of the Malatesta family, who ruled the nearby seaport of Rimini, San Marino enjoyed the protection of the rival family of Montefeltro, who ruled Urbino. By the middle of the 15th century, it was a republic ruled by a Grand Council—60 men taken from the Arengo, or Assembly of Families. Warding off serious attacks in the 16th century (including an occupation by Cesare Borgia in 1503), San Marino survived the Renaissance as a relic of the self-governing Italian city-states. Rule by an oligarchy and attempts to annex it to the Papal States in the 18th century marked the decline of the republic.When Napoleon invaded Italy, he respected the independence of the republic and even offered to extend its territory (1797). The Congress of Vienna (1815), at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, also recognized its independent status. During the 19th-century movement for Italian unification, San Marino offered asylum to revolutionaries, among them Giuseppe Garibaldi. After Italy became a national state, a series of treaties (the first in 1862) confirmed San Marino’s independence. In World War II, San Marino remained neutral, but it was the target of a British bombing raid in 1944 and was briefly occupied by both the Germans and the Allies later that year."},{"CountryName":"Sao Tome and Principe","CulturalInfo":"This small country has a homogeneous creole culture, profoundly marked by centuries of blending elements of the dominant Roman Catholic Portuguese culture with various African influences. The kinship system is bilateral, although men traditionally have been polygynous. With the virtual absence of monogamous marriage, the conjugal system is characterized by a high incidence of multiple and serial customary unions and visiting relationships; as a result, about one-third of households are headed by females. Despite more than 500 years of Roman Catholicism, local practices have been restricted largely to baptism and a few rites, such as processions and funerals. Various traditional African practices and beliefs have always coexisted with Roman Catholicism.The lexicon of the three local creole languages is predominantly derived from Portuguese, whereas their phonology and syntax stem from African languages. Many African elements have been adopted in the cooking, customs, and beliefs of much of the population, and most people of lower socioeconomic status speak only creole in daily life. Famous examples of cultural creolization are the plays The Tragic Story of the Marquis of Mântua and Emperor Charlemagne (known as Tchiloli on São Tomé island) and Auto da Floripes, popular on Príncipe island, both of which are based on 16th-century Portuguese dramas.Sports and recreationFootball (soccer) has always been the most popular sport in the country. The first local association was founded in 1931, and a national federation was created in 1977, two years after independence. In the late 1990s the country contained some two dozen clubs competing in two divisions. The clubs of the first division compete annually for the national championship, and there is also a national cup competition. Local competitions comprising all existing sports are held annually on March 12, the National Sports Festival Day. Sao Tome and Principe first participated in the Olympic Games in 1996, when the Summer Games were held in Atlanta.Media and publishingSeveral local newspapers appear erratically, but the government-run radio and television stations provide consistent programming, and broadcasts from Portugal and France are locally retransmitted on FM channels."},{"CountryName":"South Sudan","CulturalInfo":"There are many different ethnic groups in South Sudan, each with a long history of customs and traditions. Despite a decades-long attempt by the northern-based national government of Sudan to “Arabize” the southern region in the 20th century, a rich cultural diversity still exists in South Sudan.Daily life and social customsSome aspects of South Sudan’s traditional cultures have weakened with the passage of time. Indeed, the advances of modern society, such as improved communications, opportunities for increased social and economic mobility, and the spread of a money economy, as well as decades of warfare and displacement, have led to a general loosening of the social ties, customs, relationships, and modes of organization in traditional cultures. Still, much from the past remains intact.One of the most important forms of cultural expression among nonliterate groups in South Sudan is oral tradition. It is used as a vehicle for the creative expression of folklore and myths as well as for the recounting of history and traditions. It is also used as a font of guidance and advice for dealing with typical life events. Many South Sudanese groups mark the stages in the life cycle of the individual—birth, circumcision, puberty, marriage, and death—with ritual and ceremonial practices. Facial scarring and tattooing as methods of ritual adornment are common. Most groups observe patrilineal descent, but the significance of such agnatic ties among kin groups differs from one society to another. Polygyny is practiced in some groups and regarded as a means of extending affinal (in-law) relationships and acquiring support. Although divorce is now common, in the past a broken marriage was considered a shameful thing because it destroyed the network of relationships. Most groups have historically had some form of class distinction.Cuisine varies throughout the country and among ethnic groups. Grains such as millet and sorghum are popular sources of sustenance and are supplemented by the variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes grown in the country, when available. Fish is a common source of protein among the riverine communities, whereas other groups rely more on meat and milk products from their livestock. A paste made from peanuts may accompany meats and vegetables. Examples of some foods and dishes enjoyed in the country include kisra, a wide flat bread that accompanies many meals, asida, a porridge made from sorghum that is often served with meat or vegetables, and ful, a dish with a basis of mashed fava beans and spices that may have various other foods added to it.Western-style clothing is common, especially in cities and towns. Traditional dress varies throughout the country and among ethnic groups. Because of the hot climate, clothing tends to be loose-fitting and of light material.Holidays observed in South Sudan include Sudan Independence Day on January 1 (marking Sudan’s independence from Great Britain and Egypt in 1956), Peace Agreement Day on January 9 (commemorating the signing of the 2005 CPA), SPLA Day on May 16 (marking the day in 1983 that the southern troops revolted, leading to a resumption in the fight for independence), and Martyrs’ Day on July 30 (the anniversary of the death of rebel leader John Garang de Mabior, used to commemorate the deaths of all those who died during the long-running civil war). The country’s large Christian population celebrates Easter and Christmas, and Christmas Day is a public holiday in South Sudan.The arts of South SudanWomen working with beads to create necklaces, Juba, South Sudan.Women working with beads to create necklaces, Juba, South Sudan.South Sudan’s various ethnic groups have a history of producing various handicrafts. The Zande, for example, were prominent as craftsmen and artists. Their superior material culture, particularly their knives, spears, and shields, was one of the factors by which they dominated their neighbours and brought about the spread of their culture. Basketry, net weaving, pottery, smelting, metalworking, and ivory and wood carving also were undertaken. Contemporary Zande are still noted for their iron, clay, and wood handicrafts. Some modern South Sudanese artists include painters who use acrylic, water, or oil paints.Music is an integral part of the cultural traditions of South Sudan’s ethnic groups, as many ritual ceremonies are accompanied by singing and the playing of musical instruments. A variety of musical styles are enjoyed as entertainment in South Sudan. There is a traditional style of music, in which singers perform without musical accompaniment or with only a limited drumbeat. Western music styles, such as hip-hop and reggae, are popular. Also popular is a music style known as Sudanese or Sudanic fusion, which is a melding of Arabic and African rhythms. Dance is an integral part of the cultural traditions of South Sudan’s ethnic groups.Cultural institutionsThe tomb of John Garang de Mabior, Juba, South Sudan.South Sudan has a rich, long cultural history. However, decades of marginalization by the northern-based government of Sudan, the long-running civil conflict, and the necessary focus on constructing basic infrastructure have meant that historically only limited resources could be devoted to cultural institutions. There is the Nyakuron Cultural Centre in Juba, which hosts many cultural and social events. The mausoleum of rebel leader John Garang, also in Juba, is a site of importance."},{"CountryName":"Suriname","CulturalInfo":"Suriname is a culturally diverse society, with harmonious contact between its ethnic groups in the cultural sphere. Fine arts, such as painting and sculpture, were traditionally middle-class concerns dominated by Western cultural standards, but since independence the works of artists from different ethnic groups have received more recognition. Culinary traditions cross ethnic lines, and elements from South Asian, Javanese, Creole, Western African, and Chinese cuisine are often blended.The artsSuriname’s art forms derive from several ethnic traditions. Those of Javanese descent, for example, support a number of gamelan (Indonesian orchestra) troupes. Suriname’s Indians and Maroons developed a strong crafts industry, producing colourful textiles, baskets, and wood carvings for export.Most Surinamese writing is in the Dutch, Sranan, and Hindi languages. Among the country’s leading writers are Albert Helman, whose published works include dozens of volumes of fiction and plays; Martinus Haridat Luchtman, who, under the pen name Shrinivasi, is the author of several books of poems; Astrid Roemer, a popular novelist; and Cynthia McLeod, who has written several historical novels that have earned a wide readership in both Suriname and the Netherlands.Surinamese music is represented by musical groups such as Fra Fra Bigband, an orchestra from Paramaribo that blends indigenous forms of kaseko (dance music combining Western march, jazz, and calypso), kawina (a type of Creole pop music), and winti (ritual music) to form a distinctly Surinamese brand of Afro-Caribbean jazz. In recent years, Suriname-based groups also have collaborated with Western African musicians, adding talking drums and thumb pianos (lamellaphones) to their instrumentation.Sports and recreationThe country’s most popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, and volleyball. Although Suriname has no professional sports teams, several Surinamese players have become members of well-known European soccer clubs. Suriname made its Olympic debut at the 1968 Mexico City Games. Suriname’s Anthony Nesty won the gold medal in the 100-metre butterfly competition at the 1988 Seoul Games and later earned a bronze in the same event at the 1992 Barcelona Games.Fishing is a common recreational sport, particularly from August to October, when many people fish with bamboo poles in freshwater swamps and creeks. Hunting is also popular. A traditional Surinamese activity is birdkeeping. The most commonly caught birds are the large-billed seed finches (Oryzoborus crassirostris) known in the country as twa-twas. A competition among these whistling birds takes place Sunday mornings at Independence Square in Paramaribo and in other cities throughout Suriname.Media and publishingAll non-government-owned media were shut down in 1982. However, since then several private entities resumed operation. The major independent daily newspapers are De Ware Tijd (“The True Times”) and De West (“The West”); both are printed in Dutch. Most of the government-owned television and radio stations broadcast in Dutch, and some also air in local languages. There are a large number of smaller commercial radio stations."}]
